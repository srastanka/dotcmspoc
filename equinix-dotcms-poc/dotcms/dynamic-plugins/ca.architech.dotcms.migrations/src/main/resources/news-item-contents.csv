Technology-based tools, such as personalized deals based on a statistical understanding of past purchases and mobile apps that offer shopping lists and quick scan payment systems, are among the most effective tools at a retailer’s disposal.","<p>There&rsquo;s no denying that today&rsquo;s retailers need to be tech savvy to maintain and grow customer traffic. Technology-based tools, such as personalized deals based on a statistical understanding of past purchases and mobile apps that offer shopping lists and quick scan payment systems, are among the most effective tools at a retailer&rsquo;s disposal.</p>
<p>However, retailers today also need to be demographic-savvy. To get there, you need to be proactively focused on which ethnic communities live near individual stores, what products those communities are looking for, and presenting new offerings in creative ways in-store. Done right, ethnic product lines can drive significant foot traffic into stores while also growing basket size.</p>
<p>Retailers already focus on customer lifestyle and stage of life, but in many Canadian towns and cities that is simply not enough. There are countless studies pointing to the changing ethnic landscape in the Canadian marketplace.</p>
<p>One such study, the Canadian Food Trends 20/20 Report, highlights &ldquo;The New Face of Canada.&rdquo; The impact is especially true for urban centres where visible minorities will make up 50% of shoppers. Statistics Canada predicts that by 2031, the South Asian population alone will reach up to 4.1 million. To understand and anticipate the best opportunities for assortment optimization, grocers need to embrace these ethnicities in their areas.</p>
<p>For many big chain grocers, shortchanging ethnic product mix is a missed opportunity. Nearly nine out of 10 ethnic Canadian grocery shoppers in The Modern Grocery Shopper: Attitudes and Opinions Survey*, conducted by LoyaltyOne in August 2014, said the selection of ethnic food and ingredients is an important feature in choosing which grocery stores to shop at. But two-thirds say that they have to visit three or more stores &mdash; including independent retailers, specialty food stores, and online retailers &mdash; to buy everything they need. Nearly the same number (63%) say they&rsquo;re not finding enough ethnic food and ingredients at their main grocery store.<img src=""/dotAsset/24427381-9d53-4791-b5bc-dd6b50ee9643.jpg"" width=""215"" height=""215"" alt=""For many big chain grocers, shortchanging ethnic product mix is a missed opportunity."" title=""For many big chain grocers, shortchanging ethnic product mix is a missed opportunity."" style=""float: right;"" /></p>
<p>The opportunity also includes non-ethnic shoppers. Significantly, 45% of non-ethnic Canadian consumers also say that they also can&rsquo;t find the assortment of ethnic foods and ingredients they&rsquo;d like at their primary grocery store. The majority of both segments &mdash; 81% of ethnic consumers and 66% of non-ethnic consumers &mdash; report that they would cook ethnic cuisine more often if the ingredients were more readily available at their local store.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a practical issue to consider in approaching this cross-category assortment opportunity. How do you introduce more ethnic products into stores that already are stocking upwards of 40,000 products?</p>
<p><strong>The solution: Identify &mdash; then trial and repeat.</strong> Grocers who are exploring new product assortments should take a two-pronged, data-based approach. First, they should identify low-performing shelf items. When selecting these items, it&rsquo;s critical to complement traditional item volume/sales metrics with a data-driven understanding &ldquo;item importance.&rdquo; In other words, items that are most valued by your best customers. Grocers should cross-check low-performing items against what their most valuable customers buy, to ensure that they can be removed from the assortment with low risk.</p>
<p>The second step would be to use a rigorous trial and repeat approach for each new item introduced into the assortment.</p>
<p>Grocers can use data to help clarify the transferability of sales between similar items and how important specific products are to a store&rsquo;s most loyal customers to mitigate any risks. Data can also identify who will embrace new ethnic products. Grocers can identify customers who are already purchasing products that may be similar or complimentary to new ethnic offerings. New products can be added to the store creatively, into areas other than the ethnic foods aisle. Overlaying customer data with area demographics can help grocers recognize the full potential of their assortment opportunity. New ethnic products can be introduced in the highest potential stores on a Test &amp; Learn basis.</p>
<p><strong>Bottom line: Catering to richly diverse audiences provides an opportunity to better satisfy the needs of today&rsquo;s shoppers.</strong> Ethnic product mix may not get as much as attention as a marketer&rsquo;s technological tools, but it should. Retailers that take note and offer a product assortment to meet these needs will develop a loyal following of valuable customers that will only continue to grow in importance and profitability.</p>

<p>Numerous perspectives have been offered on the retailer&rsquo;s misfortunes and the root cause. Suffice it to say, most include some reference to the company&rsquo;s inability to select the right product assortment and get it on shelves in sufficient volumes along with price discrepancies notwithstanding currency exchange rates.</p>
<p>Years before its launch in Canada (2011), Gregg Steinhafel, the then chairman, president and CEO of Target heralded what was to be &lsquo;in-store&rsquo; for shoppers in Canada: [We&rsquo;re] &ldquo;excited to bring our broad assortment of unique, high-quality merchandise at exceptional values and our convenient shopping environment to Canadian guests coast to coast.""&nbsp; Editorial, plentiful, and for the most part favourable in the early days, included reference to the positive impact of Target.&nbsp; With some stories suggesting Target&rsquo;s arrival stood to have a positive impact on the entire retail sector as Canadians opted to shop locally, versus south of the border, thereby supporting the nearly 30,000 employees Target projected it would hire upon opening its doors.&nbsp;<img src=""/dotAsset/49db6687-101a-41ec-90ef-7ab3580942d7.jpg"" width=""250"" height=""167"" alt=""How did Target fail to gain their loyalty in Canada?"" title=""How did Target fail to gain their loyalty in Canada?"" style=""float: right;"" /></p>
<p>Target is a hugely successful retailer in the US so they deserve the benefit of the doubt and we should assume they were clear on their strategy anchored in their assortment, value and shopping experience.&nbsp; So how did the retailer, known for its ability to wow Canadians south of the border, fail to gain their loyalty here?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Appreciating the irony, I would suggest that what Target in Canada failed to do was in fact target.&nbsp; They were so ready to make a splash, so ready to take the market by storm, it&rsquo;s entirely possible that Target fell into the trap of assuming that what had worked for them in the past for their US-based customers and for their occasional hop-across-the-border Canadian customers would work when applied across Canada in its entirety. &nbsp;So the question then becomes: how did this happen? &nbsp;</p>
<p>Big data is becoming a focus for many companies. Some are learning how to become effective at its application and Target is frequently held up as a great example of this approach in the US.&nbsp; &nbsp;The pre-existence of its REDCard should have given Target a strategic advantage when it came to better satisfying its Canadian customers and driving preference among the most lucrative of them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was suggested by some that Target&rsquo;s REDCard, which it started to issue a month before it began to open its stores in Canada, had the potential to shake up the loyalty market in Canada, in part because it offered a 5-per-cent discount on almost all purchases made with the chain&rsquo;s credit or debit card (as compared with domestic cards estimated at 1 to 2 per cent of spending)<a href=""http://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/retailers-step-up-as-target-raises-bar-for-loyalty-cards/article6655369/""><sup>1</sup></a>.&nbsp; Target also touted it as adding significant value in the minds of its customers.&nbsp; It also, stood to offer big value to the bottom line.</p>
<p>The value in doing so cannot be understated. Research by LoyaltyOne indicates that when retailers and CPG manufacturers take a customer-centric approach across pricing, promotions, assortment and marketing, we consistently see measureable improvements of a 1% to 4% increase in overall sales and a 4% to 7% increase in gross profits. For a $2 billion retailer this can equate to an additional $80 million in sales per year and an additional $30 million in gross profits. Customer-centricity not only offers one-time benefits. It helps create sustainable improvements in business performance year after year by consistently earning the loyalty of customers.</p>
<p>Target&rsquo;s highly anticipated arrival and rapid descent offers invaluable lessons to retailers.&nbsp; As their very public failure showed us, brand equity alone is not the Holy Grail and cannot stave off failure.&nbsp; Retailers need to understand the needs of their customers at very granular and personal levels and then rapidly determine what actions need to be taken to best satisfy those needs in order to earn the loyalty of their customers.&nbsp; With Target rolling out to so many locations so quickly not only did this present significant supply chain challenges it also meant they had to rapidly learn about customer preferences in multiple, and oftentimes very different, locations where existing competitors were fully entrenched.<img src=""/dotAsset/aa70876f-b730-4c58-ac32-1ddc80afb40f.jpg"" width=""250"" height=""167"" alt=""Target&rsquo;s highly anticipated arrival and rapid descent offers invaluable lessons to retailers."" title=""Target&rsquo;s highly anticipated arrival and rapid descent offers invaluable lessons to retailers."" style=""float: right;"" /></p>
<p>Retail strategies that do not include at their core enterprise data management and analyses forgo the real upside which enables a retailer to build its business and tailor its value proposition with precision in a margin-squeezed and competitive marketplace.&nbsp; Many of us may have ventured into a Target store to see firsthand what the retailer had to offer and just why our friends and neighbours loved the US experience or perhaps were among those willing to line up for hours when its pop-up stores first launched in Canada; but the evidence appears to suggest that far fewer of us are sufficiently similar to their core US customer that they could directly transplant their wining US formula to Canada.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And while we may be focused on Target and the headlines they&rsquo;ve generated, it&rsquo;s fair to say it&rsquo;s not the only retailer failing to use big data. Many retailers are sitting on a wealth of big data in the form of their customer purchase or loyalty data.&nbsp; Already in a structured format, this data is readily available to retailers and lends itself to a number of analytical capabilities that are already battle-tested in the real world.&nbsp; Ironically, in far too many instances, the big data generated by loyalty programs and its massive value remains underutilized.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Leadership at the boardroom table might be interested to know that a 2014&nbsp; survey by LoyaltyOne of US retailers/manufacturers and consumers found 80 percent (8 in 10) of customers feel that the customer-centric benefits provided by retailers is not relevant to them, be it in-store (76%), direct (82%) or via the web (77%).</p>
<p>Of note, the same study found 83% of retail customers reported to shopping at the same primary store for more than three years, even while the general trend is that customers are splitting their purchases across more retail outlets. That means that Target, and any other retailer looking to gain share of wallet and drive sustainable growth, needs to be even better at consistently satisfying their best customers&rsquo; needs to ensure they earn their loyalty across the retailer&rsquo;s full value proposition.</p>
<p>The REDCard enabled Target a forum to engage and verify in the forum where it really counts &ndash; the store. This real time data gave them the capacity to adapt, deepen their offering in core areas and in others that failed to perform, drop them.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;What&rsquo;s more, Target has reported that customers paying with a REDcard spend an average of 50-per-cent more than non-card holders which in theory would have put pressure on other retailers keep their own best customers from switching especially given the hype.&nbsp; The questions that remain unanswered: so what in fact was the adoption rate here in Canada?&nbsp; We know Target reported more than 30,000 Canadians had a card December 2012, prior to its arrival in Canada and that it was cited as being a rapidly growing program.&nbsp;<img src=""/dotAsset/26c735c3-1b5a-4db5-9c42-f3e0d8bf1746.jpg"" width=""250"" height=""167"" alt=""When entering a new market it is essential to learn about customer needs and then adapt and adjust"" title=""When entering a new market it is essential to learn about customer needs and then adapt and adjust"" style=""float: right;"" /></p>
<p>Did they not manage to gather and analyze data from the Red Card quickly enough?&nbsp; Were they too busy fixing their supply chain issues to take actions based upon the analytics? I&rsquo;d guess it is some combination of all of the above.</p>
<p>As Target continues to wind down its Canadian operations and as new US and international retailers seek to expand here, we would be remiss in not stopping and taking stock of all the facets at play in this untimely ending.&nbsp; When entering a new market it is essential to learn about customer needs as rapidly as possible and then adapt and adjust before the honeymoon period is over &ndash; any always-on, dynamic analytic platform is an essential ingredient in achieving this objective.&nbsp; The marketplace will continue to shift, but what won&rsquo;t change is the potential for retailers to tap big data so that they can effectively focus and recalibrate their offering in real time while they&rsquo;re firing, and with dire consequences, missing the mark.</p>

<p><strong>Loyalty: There&rsquo;s more than meets the eye</strong> <strong></strong></p>
<p>Retailers understand the importance of satisfying the needs of customers to maximize their chances of earning customer loyalty and competing most effectively in the market. This activity around loyalty programs highlights the realization that leading retailers are not delivering the kind of value proposition that is meeting customer needs in the best possible way. The varied responses indicate that retailers are trying different approaches to address the business challenges that are being driven by increasingly informed, discerning shoppers in addition to heightened competition and new retail players.<img src=""/dotAsset/12d8b295-d27d-41be-8f6b-775e329cca10.jpg"" width=""210"" height=""210"" alt=""When a program is used to drive value, the retailer is making an investment that is leveraging a small component of the holistic value proposition. "" title=""When a program is used to drive value, the retailer is making an investment that is leveraging a small component of the holistic value proposition. "" style=""float: right;"" /></p>
<p>Some retailers address the situation by avoiding the standard two-tier discount card approach, abandoning existing card-based programs, or by evolving their offerings. These approaches highlight a recurring challenge: loyalty programs are viewed in simplistically when they should be part of a broader, strategic approach.</p>
<p>A loyalty program has two objectives: provide a customer identifier so needs can be understood and satisfied; and offer an additional marketing vehicle to the toolkit to reward and recognize loyalty &ndash; this is the key to a successful loyalty effort. When a program is used to drive value, the retailer is making an investment that is leveraging a small component of the holistic value proposition.</p>
<p>Customer data should be used to inform the overall strategy so finite resources can be allocated to the best loyalty-driven opportunities. Once the strategy is set, if a retailer wants to maximize the value of their data and earn customer loyalty, they need to use data to drive decisions across price, promotion, assortment, marketing, and vendor collaboration efforts. The retailer should use also be using data to enhance the benefit of their loyalty program so the standalone value proposition is most appealing to customers.<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>What&rsquo;s happening in grocery retail and what about EDLP?</strong></p>
<p>In the grocery sector, retailers are falling into one of three groups: those without a traditional program, those who had a program and abandoned it, and those who have a program and continue to leverage it. It would be misleading to assume that grocery retailers who don&rsquo;t have a traditional loyalty program are not interested in loyalty&ndash; it would be more accurate to say that they use different approaches to earn it.</p>
<p>Leading retailers who don&rsquo;t have a visible program employ different ways of understanding and satisfying customers&rsquo; needs better than the competition. Some use primary market research to understand needs, and others have store associates gather feedback by providing excellent in-store service. But even retailers that adopt these types of approaches are running other customer identification programs, such as email sign-ups, individual customer accounts on the website, in-store kiosks, and recently, deploying smartphone apps.</p>
<p>Some retailers who don&rsquo;t employ a traditional program are offering a very distinctive value proposition like the new, ultra Every Day Low Price (EDLP) players. They say they don&rsquo;t need a loyalty program as they offer customers the low prices they&rsquo;ve always wanted. There&rsquo;s also merit to the &ldquo;build it and they will come&rdquo; approach that&rsquo;s focused on low prices, as some consumers prefer this tactic.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s interesting is that Walmart has the scale, operating experience, negotiating leverage to drive costs, lowest prices, and competes solely on an EDLP level. But they&rsquo;ve acknowledged that many consumers have different needs across the holistic retailer value proposition, from price, quality, availability, convenience, service, and customer experience. Taking this approach doesn&rsquo;t mean that a traditional discount card is the right solution; just look at Walmart&rsquo;s recent launch of their smartphone app, Savings Catcher. It combines low price offerings with a value-added app, while also providing a customer identification mechanism.<img src=""/dotAsset/016f80b9-235c-49b9-aa2e-c3e9e390383c.jpg"" width=""210"" height=""210"" alt=""For retailers that have abandoned their loyalty programs, it is interesting to see other forms of loyalty re-emerging."" title=""For retailers that have abandoned their loyalty programs, it is interesting to see other forms of loyalty re-emerging."" style=""float: right;"" /></p>
<p><strong>Emerging value propositions and the future</strong></p>
<p>For retailers that have abandoned their loyalty programs, it is interesting to see other forms of loyalty re-emerging. Some of the Albertson&rsquo;s banners have a program called MyMixx, which requires a phone number as the identifier and a click-to-cloud option for coupons. This approach is gaining momentum and it could be a nod to retailers who don&rsquo;t have a mechanism to identify customers. It&rsquo;s probably an indicator that the traditional loyalty card is not necessarily the right mechanism, rather than suggesting that retailers don&rsquo;t want to understand their customers&rsquo; needs.<strong></strong></p>
<p>Target has had their REDcard for some time, so why the stealthy introduction of a new loyalty card? The REDcard is a debit card with a required credit check, which limits one of the main objectives of a loyalty program &ndash; the easy usage of signing up for the program &ndash; thus reducing the number of sign ups. But traditional loyalty cards fall short on the second loyalty program objective, which is to provide a differentiated value proposition that earns customer loyalty.</p>
<p>Perhaps this is why REDperks is being introduced &ndash; it should increase the number of customers who sign-up to the program and provide Target with a greater percentage of sales tied to a customer identifier. This allows for a higher number of customer and transaction analytics, thereby expanding the reach of Target&rsquo;s personalization efforts and further differentiates themselves with more of their customer base.</p>
<p>I look forward to following the progress of these great retailers as they embark on their different approaches to loyalty. Although the marketplace is constantly changing, the most successful retailers will be those who use customer data to consistently satisfy customers&rsquo; needs better than the competition.</p>

The number of Canadian loyalty program memberships is now 129.73 million, up from 119.97 million in 2012.<br /><br />The&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20150212006014/en/Canadian-Loyalty-Market-Bounces-2015-COLLOQUY-Census#.VP8er-GGNGZ"" target=""_blank"">statistics are from the 2015 COLLOQUY Loyalty Census</a>, which builds on COLLOQUY&rsquo;s biennial census-taking of Canada&rsquo;s loyalty industry since 2008.<br /><br />We&rsquo;re seeing the most activity among retail programs. With 62.1 million program members, retailers account for 48% of total Canadian loyalty program memberships. That&rsquo;s up from 46% two years earlier. Retailers grew memberships by 12.3% -- the largest jump of any sector -- in the last two years. And numbers were up across the board: For the first time since COLLOQUY began tracking Canadian programs, membership numbers improved in every economic sector covered in the census (retail, financial services, coalition programs and travel/gaming/dining/entertainment/other).<br /><br />All these signs of interest in loyalty programs bodes well for marketers. They are overtures by consumers who are open to making deeper commitments to their favorite companies.&nbsp;<br /><br />But program numbers are only the first step. The size of a membership base isn&rsquo;t the best indicator of whether a program is generating the kind of engagement that is the real goal of loyalty marketing. And more loyalty memberships overall presents challenges to every individual loyalty marketer. How will your program stand out amid the program noise vying for consumer attention?&nbsp;<br /><br />Lots of companies are doing the right things to generate traction for their programs. Here are some observations:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Successful programs meet customers where they are.</strong>&nbsp;That means thinking bigger when it comes to mobile, integrating loyalty features into mobile and dumping mediocre, poor-performing apps. In the last few years, for instance, both PC Plus and Canadian Tire gave their programs appealing facelifts, and both have apps with high-value features: The&nbsp;<a href=""https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pc-plus/id634040057?mt=8"" target=""_blank"">PC Plus app</a>&nbsp;lets customers get personalized points offers based on the items they buy most and lets them link to Passbook to enable scan and go, while&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.canadiantire.ca/en/mobile.html#iphone"" target=""_blank"">Canadian Tire&rsquo;s app</a>&nbsp;gives members alerts when products on their shopping lists go on sale. These are examples of loyalty marketers looking at their program&rsquo;s performance through the lens of evolving consumer expectations.</li>
<li><strong>It pays to aggregate mobile data with loyalty and transactional data.</strong>&nbsp;Merging customer intelligence across databases allows companies to create a holistic view of customers and to truly personalize marketing messages and loyalty offers.&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.sephora.com/mobile?icid2=sephora_social_footer_122614_can_image"" target=""_blank"">Sephora&rsquo;s To Go app</a>&nbsp;creates an omni-channel shopping experience for Canadian customers, enabling members to receive limited-time deals, manage their reward accounts and view past purchases. Advances in customer experience -- facilitated by technology -- are what customers expect when they start sharing their personal data. Companies need to make the &ldquo;I tell you about me, and you give me value for doing so&rdquo; transaction pay off.</li>
<li><strong>Smart marketers respond to changes in their overall industry&rsquo;s demographics.</strong>Hotels have started tailoring customer experiences to engage different segments of travelers. In particular, hotel companies have taken notice that larger numbers of guests now fall between the ages of 18 and 36. That means increasing their digital offerings and allowing guests to book rooms using Twitter.</li>
</ul>
<p>Competition is poised to get more intense, especially in the retail space. <a href=""/news-events/latest-news/ready-fire-oh-canada-did-we-forget-aim"" target=""_blank"">Target is leaving Canada</a>, but US-based DSW and Nordstrom are both expanding their footprints here. Retailers can expect to see more program membership growth -- and competition -- from those two companies alone.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />The sheer volume of loyalty programs on the marketplace is beyond any marketer&rsquo;s control. But how well a company&rsquo;s own loyalty platform engages members, enhances the consumer experience and adapts to changing technology are issues that can be, and must be, front of mind.</p>",,"Loyalty Marketing, Growing, Loyalty, Membership, Canada, Canadians, Shoppers, Shopping","industry.consumergoods,industry.retail","capability.coalitionloyalty,capability.customloyaltyservices","brand.loyaltyone,brand.colloquy",1aceaf7d-8ff0-40d4-b101-bfed98233989,,1

When grocers make the investment to understand who their shoppers are and use that knowledge to make the shopping experience truly focused on customer needs, they earn their loyalty and encourage customers to consolidate their spend, resulting in increased frequency of shopper visits and basket size.

<p>Retailers and manufacturers understand that building pricing, promotion, assortment and marketing decisions around customer needs is an essential approach to success.

<p>The troubling news is that we&rsquo;re seeing a perception gap between how good a job retailers think they&rsquo;re doing and how customers really see their relationships with retailers. Top retailers believe they&rsquo;re embracing shopper insights, but something&rsquo;s not resonating.</p>
<p><strong>Let&rsquo;s look at the details.</strong></p>
<p>More than nine in 10 top U.S. retailers say they consistently leverage customer insights to develop strategies and plans across the organization. They say they regularly track customer metrics, use customer insights for digital, social and mobile plans, heavily invest in staffing and technical resources, and educate store personnel on using customer insights in their daily jobs.</p>
<p>These retailers also say they consistently draw from customer insights to improve the in-store experience, to deliver personalized marketing communications and to collaborate with manufacturers.</p>
<p>For the top U.S. retailers, that&rsquo;s doing a lot of things right.</p>
<p>However, we also surveyed U.S. shoppers who say they aren&rsquo;t feeling personalization or relevance in their shopping experiences overall. Instead, they&rsquo;re reporting luke-warm attention:</p>
<ul>
<li>64 percent say the offers (e.g. coupons) they get are the same as everyone else&rsquo;s</li>
<li>50 percent say companies do not consistently send personalized and relevant marketing communications</li>
<li>40 percent say companies do not know how they prefer to receive promotional offers (e.g. coupons by mail)</li>
<li>35 percent say they do not receive promotional offers for products that they want</li>
</ul>
<p>Our research shows that while retailers say they&rsquo;re delivering, shoppers just aren&rsquo;t buying it.</p>
<p>Interestingly, customers say they want the experience to be more personalized. Ninety-two percent say they&rsquo;d like the retailer they most recently shopped at to send them relevant coupons. Ninety-four percent say they&rsquo;d like a loyalty card or app with the ability to earn and redeem points or miles, and would like to receive special offers and discounts based on their loyalty. Eighty percent say they&rsquo;d like companies to use their data to decide which products and services to offer or eliminate.<img src=""/dotAsset/1a1e21e2-76bb-4026-a6a0-f569b577fcc6.jpg"" width=""300"" height=""214"" alt=""Customers say they want the experience to be more personalized"" title=""Customers say they want the experience to be more personalized"" style=""float: right;"" /></p>
<p>The problem is that even as shoppers are essentially asking retailers to use their data, most retailers are not acting on the material they have. While the top U.S. retailers may be feeling good about their efforts, most retailers are still struggling to share, analyze and respond to customer data across the organization. Only half (55 percent) report that they&rsquo;re using customer data in customer service, and fewer than one in three use customer data in operations (28 percent), assortment management (28 percent) or purchasing (32 percent).</p>
<p>Grocers can overcome these challenges. Here are six areas where companies should focus on using data better to close this perception gap:</p>
<p><strong>Strategy</strong>: Shopper data insights should be used to assess current spend and model potential spend for each individual shopper at the category level. This allows the grocer to identify the greatest growth opportunities by category, customer and store, which enables them to allocate staffing and financial resources against the shoppers, categories and stores in a way that will allow them to most effectively pursue the best opportunities to profitably grow the business.</p>
<p><strong>Pricing</strong>: Pricing insights can be developed at the lowest levels of the store, product and even shopper hierarchies. Grocers can then aggressively price the items that are most important to their most valuable shoppers, aligning price plans with the needs of these shoppers. If done correctly, grocers can expect to see sales increases of 1-3 percent and gross profit increases of 2-5 percent, while enhancing price perception and improving market share.</p>
<p><strong>Promotions</strong>: Shopper insights should be used by grocers and CPG manufacturers to identify which promotions are performing well, which are not performing well but can be improved and which should be terminated. This collaboration will align grocer and manufacturer trade investments in the most productive areas, with grocers deploying promotions that target specific shopper segments and needs. Selecting the right items to promote, determining the right discounts to offer and allocating ad and display support to the right items to maximize productivity of the space also leads to dramatic improvements in performance. Expect increases in promoted sales of 3-6 percent and increases in promoted gross profits of 5-10 percent.</p>
<p><strong>Assortment</strong>: Maximizing the productivity of finite shelf space is key to retailer performance.&nbsp; Shopper insights should be used to identify which low-productivity items can be safely removed from the assortment to be replaced with higher-productivity items. Understanding item importance to most valuable shoppers and the extent of demand transfer by individual item ensures that only low-risk items are candidates for removal. This approach improves the sales performance of the low productivity items by 1-2 percent and gross profits by 2-4 percent.</p>
<p><strong>Marketing</strong>: Incremental sales from shopper marketing campaigns is usually less than 1 percent, but with a personalized approach based on shopper data this improves to nearly 4 percent in incremental sales. A personal approach also has the potential to lift campaign ROIs from less than 15 percent to more than 100 percent. Retail and CPG marketers can tailor customer marketing communications along multiple dimensions to consistently improve effectiveness in future campaigns. With these insights, grocers can gradually shift the marketing budget from mass, untargeted activities to personalized marketing across channels that drive enhanced response rates, meaningful incremental sales and highly positive marketing ROI.</p>
<p><strong>Manufacturer Collaboration</strong>: Manufacturer trading partners allocate a significant percent of their revenues to the marketing mix.&nbsp; Manufacturers, retailers and shoppers would all benefit significantly if these marketing dollars could be deployed in the most effective way to deliver enhanced customer-driven media ads, consumer promotions and trade promotions.&nbsp; Retailers who share customer insights with their manufacturer trading partners maximize their chances of aligning manufacturer marketing investments with the needs of the specific customers in their stores.</p>
<p>Retailers that understand and satisfy the needs of shoppers better than the competition will be on a path to sustainable competitive advantage and profitable growth.

<p>Discounts and convenience have always driven retail foot traffic, but I predict that in 2015 we&rsquo;ll see both reimagined in exciting ways. A recent consumer survey conducted by LoyaltyOne of 1,000 Canadian respondents suggests that this is the year retailers should more aggressively start engaging the online shopper to make in in-person visits -- using discounts and convenience as the draws.</p>
<p><strong>The omnichannel consumer is now every retailer&rsquo;s customer.</strong>&nbsp; No surprises here, but it&rsquo;s worth reiterating: no matter what industry you&rsquo;re in, your customers are moving across channels as they shop with you and your competitors. These shoppers look for some items only in person and other items only online, but they&rsquo;re also browsing some items online and then buying in-person, or, conversely, trying out items in a store then heading back online for the best deal. Consumers expect easy fluidity as they move among websites, company apps, and bricks and mortar stores. They are building their own &ldquo;clicks and mortar&rdquo; hybrid retail world.</p>
<p><strong>The good news: There are tools that can get shoppers into physical stories.</strong>&nbsp;Getting consumers actually into a store accomplishes two things: the retailer can maintain a full brand experience for customers with a chance of in-store incidental purchases, and the retailer has the opportunity to essentially eliminate competitive shopping (for the moment, anyway).</p>
<p><strong>Tool One: Discounts for in-store pickup.</strong>&nbsp;Avoiding shipping costs is among the highest motivators for in-store pickup, but our consumer survey of Canadian shoppers looked specifically at what else would draw them in-store. Two-thirds (67%) said they would come to a store to pick up their online purchase if it helps their pocketbook. Nearly the same amount (64%) said they would be willing to pick up an online purchase in-store for a discount on that product. How much of a discount? On average, they said they&rsquo;d be enticed by 10-15% off.</p>
<p><strong>Tool Two: Other perks and rewards.</strong>&nbsp;The survey also found that 49% said they&rsquo;d make an in-store pick up if they received additional loyalty program points to do so.&nbsp; And about one quarter of respondents (26%) said discounts on future purchases or additional purchases made in-store would be an incentive. That&rsquo;s intriguing, given that research from Forrester Research shows 38% of consumers have used their mobile to check inventory availability while on their way to a store and 34% have used their mobile device to research products while in a store.</p>
<p><strong>Tool Three: Concierge-type services.</strong>&nbsp;We&rsquo;re seeing this in the grocery sector: retailers capitalizing on shoppers who prioritize convenience by offering a &ldquo;reoccurring subscription&rdquo; service. With these programs, the store does the picking and packing, and customers get the products they regularly purchase ready for pickup in-store upon their arrival.&nbsp; One in five (22%) of the Canadian survey respondents said they would be interested in setting up such a service.</p>
<p><strong>One challenge will be inventory.</strong>&nbsp;In a 2014 article in the&nbsp;<em><a href=""http://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/how-to-win-in-an-omnichannel-world/%20"" target=""_blank"">MIT Sloan Management Review</a></em>, researchers David R. Bell, Santiago Gallino and Antonio Moreno noted that while fulfilling orders in stores instead of by delivery has an upside, it also poses important location and store design decisions. &ldquo;Stores have to be accessible to customers and large enough to hold inventory,&rdquo; they write. &ldquo;These constraints can translate into significant real estate costs.&rdquo; As well, &ldquo;the retailer must carry the right products in the right stores at the right time.&rdquo; Careful merchandising and accurate forecasting is more difficult to execute on a per-store basis than it is with a warehouse model.</p>
<p><strong>Still, this is the future, and the future is now.</strong>&nbsp;It may be tempting to keep taking a &ldquo;wait-and-see&rdquo; attitude toward omnichannel offerings, but if you&rsquo;re not ready to experiment with merging your audience&rsquo;s digital engagement with their in-store experiences, your competitors will be. Fortunately, done right, incentivized in-store pickup can be the ultimate win-win for retailers and customers alike.</p>

This is a huge honour and distinction. The WXN Top 100 summit and gala hosted in Toronto was truly fabulous. But now that the celebration is over, it is time to reflect.</p>
<p>What does it really mean to win this notable award? Not surprisingly, it is far more than a photo in a magazine, a party or celebratory tweets. Winning a WXN Top 100 award is actually a call to action -- and a compelling one at that -- to do more. I quickly realized that in addition to being recognized for what I had achieved, I had been tapped on the shoulder to do more -- to become an advocate for women's equality and advancement.<img src=""/dotAsset/5bb00ad2-976b-4c67-98df-43994342875a.jpg"" width=""250"" height=""250"" alt=""Angela Simo Brown accepting the WXN Award"" title=""Angela Simo Brown accepting the WXN Award"" style=""float: right; margin: 1px;"" /></p>
<p>And there is still so much to do. Listening to the many amazing women leaders speak at the WXN event about how far we have come but how far we still have to go has inspired me to commit to do what I can to accelerate positive change.</p>
<p>Really, we shouldn't need to have special women leadership awards. But despite the progress in women's advancement that we have made in Canada, compared to men, women are still underpaid, under-represented on boards, and under-represented in corporate and political senior leadership. Today a woman earns $0.76 for every dollar a man makes. In Canada, women only make up 10 per cent of board representation. And 40 per cent of Canadian boards have zero female representation. Only 5 per cent of Fortune 1000 CEOs are women, and only 21 per cent of federal political leaders. We have work to do.</p>
<p>So where does our system break down? In Canada, throughout our education girls and young women are told we are equal. But when we graduate from school and hit the job market things are different. To achieve our goals, women need help navigating this unexpected world. As Marilyn Emery, CEO of Women's College Hospital, said at the WXN Summit, in order to succeed women must actively do three key things:</p>
<p>1) Network, 2) Seek leadership opportunities and 3) Get mentors. Women also need to find champions within their organizations who will actively advocate for their advancement. We as WXN Top 100 winners must play an active leadership role in mentoring and helping women leaders find sponsors who will support their advancement.</p>
<p>And it doesn't stop there. There is a role for male leaders too. For example Purdy Crawford, the Canadian business icon who passed away earlier this year, was justly celebrated for his role in developing promising young female talent into leaders in both the business and public sectors. He mentored several notable female leaders including former Home Depot Canada chief executive Annette Verschuren and Bertha Wilson, the first woman on the Supreme Court of Canada.<img src=""/dotAsset/9d7eda5b-e11c-4401-b86c-c40b65d7c67b.jpg"" width=""250"" height=""250"" alt=""Angela with LoyaltyOne associates at the WXN Gala"" title=""Angela with LoyaltyOne associates at the WXN Gala"" style=""float: right; margin: 1px;"" /></p>
<p>In addition to individual mentoring efforts, organizations need to establish mentoring programs. At LoyaltyOne, we have a Women's Leadership Initiative which is dedicated to the advancement of women within our company. The Initiative includes a robust mentoring program and after four years we are pleased to have almost 25 per cent of female associates participating. LoyaltyOne recently won top employer in Canada for the sixth year in a row, and our Women's Leadership Initiative program is an important part of our employee development portfolio that attracts and retains talent.</p>
<p>As Kathleen Taylor, Chair RBC, said in her inspiring keynote speech at the WXN Top 100 gala, ""With great recognition comes great responsibility."" As WXN Top 100 winners we have an obligation to use our influence to continue to forward the women's movement in Canada. But we can't do it alone -- all female and male leaders in our great country need to make this social change a priority. There is a Buddhist saying that thousands of candles can be lit from a single candle and the life of the single candle will not be diminished. Let's start lighting candles -- we have nothing to lose and much to gain.</p>",,"WXN, women in leadership, Leadership, Social Change, Equality, Powerful Women, Best Employers","industry.health,industry.publicsectorandutilities",,brand.loyaltyone,SYSTEM_HOST,,1

However factors such as time, money and routine often get in the way of their goals to become healthier.</p>
<p>With that in mind, grocers are in a unique position to help their shoppers navigate barriers and make it easier for them to make the healthy lifestyle choices they&rsquo;re leaning toward. When this happens, it creates a win-win for grocers and their shoppers.</p>
<p>The trend toward health continues: according to the Food Marketing Institute&rsquo;s (FMI) 2014 Shopping for Health study, 43% of shoppers say they&rsquo;re eating more products with whole grains, 44% say they&rsquo;re buying more fresh ingredients, and one third say they&rsquo;re making purchases with an eye on nutritional labels and reduced or no calories/fat/sugar/salt.</p>
<p>At the same time, nearly two out of three consumers also say they aren&rsquo;t eating as well as they would like to because changing their eating habits is too hard. The key for grocers is in understanding their shoppers so they can help make these products more accessible and more appealing.</p>
<p>A data-driven understanding of shoppers offers a myriad of opportunities for grocers to deliver on their shoppers&rsquo; healthy eating resolutions, essentially showing their shoppers that the store is &ldquo;on their side&rdquo; when it comes to healthy food choices.</p>
<p><a href=""/customer-analytics/"" target=""_blank"">New analytical and technology capabilities</a> allow for both better merchandising decisions as well as personalized offers based on an understanding of shoppers&rsquo; past-behaviours, life-stage, lifestyle and potential value. Detailed shopper segmentation helps grocers deliver against their shoppers&rsquo; needs and preferences via personalized offers and better merchandising in-store.</p>
<p>Optimizing their pricing, promotions, assortment and offers<strong></strong>on healthy food items, grocers&ndash;particularly at the start of 2015&ndash;are well positioned to grow basket sizes with healthy products, as well as cross-sell healthy options to a wider shopper base. Grocers can also use this opportunity for innovation and product development.</p>
<p>Understanding health trends across key categories can draw attention to priority areas or products that could benefit from private brand development to deliver healthy products key shoppers are looking for.</p>
<p>Grocers could consider the following five strategies this January to support their shoppers&rsquo; New Year&rsquo;s resolutions:</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;""><strong>Empower:</strong>&nbsp;According to FMI&rsquo;s 2014 Shopping for Health study, 65% of shoppers say that a desire to lose or maintain weight affects their food purchase decisions. Empower shoppers by demonstrating an awareness of and support for their goals. There are many ways to do this both in-store and online. For merchandisers, analytics can identify the key categories and items that are trending heavily toward healthier options and those that are underdeveloped.&nbsp;Grocers can use this information to laser-in on key areas to reset the assortment toward healthier options to meet shoppers increasing needs. Online, grocers could consider opening an online forum about healthy eating where shoppers support and encourage each other on their goals. Another option could be to provide a healthy eating &lsquo;check list,&rsquo; where shoppers could check off when they&rsquo;ve picked up a certain amount of servings of fruit and vegetables to ensure they&rsquo;re picking up the right amount of healthy options during their grocery shop.</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;""><strong>Promote:</strong>&nbsp;Shoppers want healthy foods to be more accessible, so there is a real opportunity for customer-centric grocers to help their shoppers make healthier choices by promoting healthier options. Work closely with your partner manufacturers to promote the right items for shoppers, at the right price, to the right audience. Analyzing shopper data will identify which healthy options should be offered, at the most effective price, and to the most receptive audience.</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;""><strong>Engage:</strong>&nbsp;Offer engaging events and touch points with your shoppers. Consider using analytical insights from your shopper segmentation to host in-store food tasting stations serving healthy foods that have been determined to grow basket size of your best shoppers. Another option would be to offer in-store demonstrations for preparation of those healthy foods.</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;""><strong>Simplify:</strong>&nbsp;Fifty-eight per cent of shoppers report trying out new healthy recipes. Make it easier for your shoppers to find healthy food combinations through cross-merchandising displays with healthy meal solutions, promoting holistic solutions across key categories, and including recipes and preparation tips with key items. Also consider delivering personalized healthy meal solutions through 1-to-1 offers to each shopper based on their key shopping categories.</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;""><strong>Focus:</strong>&nbsp;Not all of your shoppers want to eat healthier. Carefully analyze your shopper data to determine which shoppers, stores and regions would benefit most from a healthy food campaign.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Bottom line:</strong>&nbsp;Grocers can win higher shopper engagement by supporting shoppers in their efforts for healthier eating. The big upsides for grocers are improved profits from the sale of higher-margin fresh food and more revenue from the higher frequency of fresh food shopping.</p>
<p>When it comes to using data to foster eating, the New Year is the perfect time to get started.</p>",,"Precima, Precima Solution, New Year's, Healthy, Healthy Eating, Grocery, Retail, Grocer, Food","industry.health,industry.consumergoods,industry.foodandbeverage,industry.retail",capability.customeranalytics,brand.precima,SYSTEM_HOST,,1

While retailers should always be looking at the return they&rsquo;re generating from their investments, the value generated from a shopper loyalty program is only partly linked to the benefits delivered. The more critical element of these programs is the use of data to better understand and satisfy shopper needs across the&nbsp;organization.</p>
<p>The issue is a large number of retailers use the data from loyalty programs to primarily drive only their program. This significantly limits the retailer&rsquo;s ability to deliver a positive ROI as the data is only being used in one decision-making area of the company. Some leading retailers are doing a good job of using the loyalty data to drive customer-marketing campaigns, however for many the data is used quite sporadically and not across the enterprise. There are only a few retailers who have managed to successfully and consistently leverage their loyalty data into the price, promotion and assortment decisions made on a daily basis by the merchandising team.<br /> <br />It&rsquo;s understandable that retailers would stop investing in loyalty programs that have a low ROI, but discontinuing the program rather than ensuring they are extracting maximum value from it will only leave them in the dark.</p>
<p>Analyzing the data from a shopper loyalty program allows retailers to better understand all of their customers, which enables them to deliver personalized offers that will be most relevant for each individual shopper &ndash; a good outcome for all parties. Retailers don&rsquo;t have unlimited budgets and need to ensure they are allocating their investments to deliver the best ROI. This could involve rewarding customers for their loyalty, encouraging shoppers to consolidate their spend with that retailer or delivering relevant offers that introduce customers to relevant new products.</p>
<p>Loyalty programs provide customer data that fuels multiple key decisions across a retail organization that drive significant customer, competitive and financial value. From a strategic perspective, it enables a retailer to understand where the largest opportunities are to grow the business from a category, customer and store perspective and then to allocate resources to pursue and capture the largest strategic growth opportunities.<img src=""/dotAsset/0f34fba7-4550-423f-a310-6244ca34a574.jpg"" width=""200"" height=""300"" alt=""Loyalty programs provide customer data that fuels multiple key decisions across a retail organization "" title=""Loyalty programs provide customer data that fuels multiple key decisions across a retail organization "" style=""float: right; margin: 1px;"" /></p>
<p>From a merchandising perspective, the retailer can align their price, promotion and assortment decisions with the greatest needs of their most loyal customers. Using shopper data, retailers can make price reduction decisions on items that are most important to their most loyal customers; design, deploy and allocate trade funds to promotions that are most valued by loyal customers; and ensure that low productivity items are only removed if they are determined to be unimportant to loyal customers.</p>
<p>Retailers need to develop the organizational capabilities to turn loyalty program data into actions that consistently satisfy the needs of customers - from strategy and marketing to merchandising, store operations and vendor collaboration. This requires a combination of technology, analytics and experienced analysts who can ensure that the data is consistently translated into actionable insights. This is a continuous process, not a one-off periodic activity that happens on a project-by-project basis. Senior management support is essential and the required change in organizational mindset should be factored in to the change management process to ensure maximum value.</p>
<p>At LoyaltyOne, we find that that when retailers take a <a href=""/research-insights/whitepapers/customer-centric-merchandising-a-pipe-dream-or-imminent-reality"" target=""_blank"">customer-centric approach</a> by using shopper data across pricing, promotions, assortment and marketing, there is measureable improvements of a 1-4% increase in overall sales and a 4-7% increase in gross profits. For a $2-billion retailer this can equate to an additional $80-million in sales per year and an additional $30-million in gross profits.</p>
<p>Retailers should take a holistic view of loyalty and view it in 3D: Loyalty as a strategy, loyalty as an outcome and loyalty as a program. First, retailers can drive their overall strategy by using customer data to ensure they are focusing resources on the opportunities that will maximize customer loyalty. Next, retailers should leverage their loyalty program data across marketing, price, promotion and assortment decisions.</p>
<p>Last, retailers need to take a broader view of the loyalty program itself as too many view them as two-tier price and discount mechanisms without enough understanding of the right mix of hard and soft benefits, fixed and variable incentives or covert and overt rewards. Retailers should be looking at their loyalty programs as a way to develop an enhanced and differentiated shopping experience with compelling benefits that reward loyal customer behavior.</p>",,"Loyalty Marketing, Loyalty Program, Card, Grocery, Retail, Analytics","industry.consumergoods,industry.retail","capability.coalitionloyalty,capability.customeranalytics,capability.customloyaltyservices",brand.precima,SYSTEM_HOST,,0

<div>No matter how market share gets divvied up, consumers will use their phones and wearables to pay. That is because we are all in the habit of taking these devices wherever we go, they are just as secure and, ultimately, they are more convenient.&nbsp;</div>
<div></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<h4><b>Remember</b></h4>
<div></div>
<div>While single-card solutions such as Coin and Plastc seek to prolong the life of physical cards by aggregating them into a single device, the speed-to-market and increased functionality of mobile is likely to stifle any attempts at significant consumer adoption.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div></div>
<div>It also is not a significant jump to say that all mobile transactions will eventually be reduced to a single scan or tap. This is not just for payments, either &ndash; redeeming offers and earning loyalty currencies, all of it will happen seamlessly. It already does when you use the Starbucks application, and MCX claims its app, when launched at major retailers such as Walmart, Target and CVS, will detect, earn and apply rewards &ldquo;automatically during the transaction.&rdquo;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div></div>
<div>Your loyalty programs will eventually be synced to your payment device or account, and you will never forget to use your loyalty card again. Coincidentally, you may start forgetting you have one.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div></div>
<div>This upcoming reality presents both challenges and opportunities for brands.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div></div>
<div>The physical card has always played the role of a mnemonic device to prompt customers so that when they shop they are conscious and active in the collection process.&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div></div>
<div>Today, when the cashier asks if you have your card and you physically search through your bag to find it, you are reminded of your participation in the program.&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div></div>
<div>What happens when that process is replaced by a digital communication? Transaction or location-triggered notifications could mediate this transition, but there is already a thin line a lot of retail apps are walking between useful information and over-communicating.&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div></div>
<div>The continued streamlining of the purchase process emphasizes a trend towards removing clutter, so incorporating loyalty earning tactfully will be essential.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<h4></h4>
<h4><b>Redeeming factors</b></h4>
<div></div>
<div>A future where you passively collect currencies is a future where they may influence you less, and yet you will collect more because you never forget to earn. This is a nightmare for loyalty practitioners: higher liabilities and less influence to show for it.</div>

<div>Brands could, of course, devalue their currency to make all the point collecting more palatable, but enjoy explaining that to valuable avid members who pay attention.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div></div>
<div>So what is the opportunity here? Redemption.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div></div>
<div>One of the single biggest reasons programs fail is that most members do not get the opportunity to redeem, to feel recognized and to validate their participation in the program.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>Redeeming for rewards is going to happen more frequently to more customers &ndash; especially those who used to forget their card.

<p>According to the <a href=""http://newsroom.bmo.com/press-releases/2014-bmo-holiday-outlook-spending-expected-to-dro-tsx-bmo-201411030976482001"" target=""_blank"">BMO Holiday Outlook</a>, Canadian consumer spending for the 2014 holiday season is expected to drop to a three-year low, with the amount spent on entertaining, dropping from $282 to $211.</p>
<p>Against this backdrop, it&rsquo;s more crucial than ever for grocers to use smart cross-merchandising to maximize holiday shoppers&rsquo; basket size.<img src=""/dotAsset/37512b7b-f8f6-42ca-ab6f-b85129bfb908.jpg"" width=""225"" height=""150"" alt=""Canadian consumer spending for the 2014 holiday season is expected to drop to a three-year low"" title=""Canadian consumer spending for the 2014 holiday season is expected to drop to a three-year low"" style=""float: right; margin: 1px;"" /></p>
<p>Today, with an average of over 43,000 items carried in each supermarket, grocery shopping choices are more abundant than ever. So why are shoppers not buying all of their required items at one grocery store? In a recent survey of Canadian grocery shoppers conducted by LoyaltyOne, it was found that Canadians are regularly shopping an average of three different grocery stores in order to find the full product selection they are looking for.</p>
<p>Grocers should consider strengthening their use of in-store cross-merchandising to better meet shoppers&rsquo; needs. During the busy holiday season, in particular, you have the opportunity to help customers cut down on the time and effort spent searching for the right products by shifting their focus to &lsquo;meal solutions&rsquo; rather than individual items. This minimizes the number of grocery stores that your shoppers need to visit, which in turn increases the average basket size (and improves your market share).</p>
<p>Top performing grocers are smarter about cross-merchandising in two ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>They look across categories to create easily-accessible solutions that meet their customers&rsquo; &lsquo;need states&rsquo; &ndash; generally defined as a group of consumers who seek similar product benefits and attributes in a particular usage occasion.</li>
<li>They understand their shoppers based on past-behaviours, lifestage, lifestyle and potential value</li>
</ol>
<p>Developing a smart cross-merchandising strategy, program or calendar for the holiday season isn&rsquo;t just about linking turkey with cranberry sauce. It requires a grocer to collaborate beyond the fundamental structure of category management in order to create a broader strategy that develops and influences your shoppers&rsquo; need state during the holiday season.</p>
<p>For example, grocers can assist time-crunched holiday shoppers by cross-merchandising food products with higher margin items such as decorations, gifts, cards and kitchen utensils/food preparation tools. This provides a busy holiday shopper a one-stop-shop for all the items they&rsquo;ll need for a holiday party. By cross-merchandising for the holiday season, a grocer brings complementary products together to deliver shopper solutions that only exist for a limited time but tie together multiple categories that are usually physically separated by aisles in store.</p>
<p><strong>What shopper data is essential for smart holiday cross-merchandising?<br /></strong><br />It&rsquo;s imperative that life stage, lifestyle, and the potential value by customer and category are looked at together and taken into consideration when developing cross-merchandising programs. This is especially important during the busy holiday season when retail space is at premium and merchandising decisions have a far larger impact on sales than at other times of the year.</p>
<p>Life stages might be considered fairly universal in retail, including groups such as &ldquo;young singles&rdquo;, &ldquo;young couples&rdquo;, &ldquo;families with babies&rdquo;, &ldquo;parents with grown children&rdquo;, and so on. However, there are important nuances to take into account and validate when segmentations are created. For example, you can&rsquo;t simply assume that someone who starts to regularly buy diapers is automatically a family buying for a baby. It could be a grandparent or caregiver, so not the primary diaper shopper, but rather someone buying only for a few months.</p>
<p>Lifestyle further defines the shopper, providing the grocer with useful attributes such as &ldquo;time-starved&rdquo; or &ldquo;convenience-focused&rdquo;. This segmentation provides retailers with a clearer idea of what solutions work best to further support of shoppers&rsquo; need states. For example, if a shopper has a high cooking aptitude and an interest in healthy products, look to provide a holiday meal solution which includes a wider number of fresh whole foods and seasonings that require more advanced at-home preparation.</p>
<p>Potential value provides retailers with an understanding of what purchases the shopper is likely making elsewhere. When potential value is combined with lifestage and lifestyle, and used in a predictive model of your shoppers&rsquo; behaviours, retailers are given a clear picture on what specific products shoppers could be buying at their store but aren&rsquo;t currently. For example, imagine a grocery shopper who regularly purchases fresh whole turkey, fresh green beans, and boxed stuffing for holiday meals. This person spends about $50 a week on their shopping basket, but other similar shoppers tend to spend around $65. What&rsquo;s missing from their basket compared to similar shoppers? Maybe it&rsquo;s bagged potatoes and pre-packaged spices? Potential value is the factor that can help identify the products required to guide the shopper to spend the additional $15 in store to complete their meal solution.</p>
<p>By identifying and understanding what strengths the store can leverage &mdash; fresh, value, convenience &mdash; and what their shoppers&rsquo; need states are, grocers are better able to deliver the most appropriate holiday solutions. The short and sweet is that if you cross-merchandise the smart way, based on an in-depth analysis of your own shopper data, you are sure to ring in the New Year on a successful note.</p>",,"Cross-Merchandising, merchandising, precima, customer analytics","industry.consumergoods,industry.foodandbeverage,industry.retail",capability.customeranalytics,brand.precima,SYSTEM_HOST,,1

Does the same principle apply in a luxury retail setting? No, says a recent study that implies that the ruder the sales staff, the better the sales.</p>
<p>Research announced earlier this year from the University of British Columbia&rsquo;s Sauder School of Business measured the impact of salesperson attitude in retail settings.</p>
<p><strong>It&rsquo;s not you &hellip;</strong><br />Through online surveys, participants imagined interactions with different types of salespeople under varying conditions. Variables included the imagined store&rsquo;s level of luxury, the extent of the salesperson&rsquo;s arrogance, how well the salesperson represented the store&rsquo;s brand, and how closely participants themselves related with the brand.</p>
<p>The study&rsquo;s findings:</p>
<p>&bull; Rejection makes people want to buy luxury goods. However, a salesperson&rsquo;s condescending attitude has little effect on mainstream retail brands such as Gap and American Eagle<img src=""/dotAsset/aeac1b30-69c4-4bbb-896b-dcb0b23025d1.jpg"" width=""325"" height=""392"" alt=""In a recent survey, rejection makes people want to buy luxury goods."" title=""In a recent survey, rejection makes people want to buy luxury goods."" style=""float: right; margin: 1px;"" /><br /> <br />&bull; Rejection strengthens purchasing when salespeople embody the luxury brands in the way they act and dress, serving as authentic representatives and reflecting brand attributes</p>
<p>&bull; Consumers have strong brand desires: those who really want to own a particular brand are even more influenced by rejection. Instead of switching their loyalties, these customers only became more attached</p>
<p>A number of psychological triggers may be behind this behavior.</p>
<p>First, the desire to belong to a social group is deep-seated in the human psyche.</p>
<p>With a luxury brand, that desire is enhanced by exclusivity &ndash; a chance to be part of a chosen few with the inherent benefits and prestige.</p>
<p>Rejection may also inspire the drive to re-establish control.</p>
<p>Customers expect to receive courteous, deferential treatment. The rude approach flips the table and puts the salesperson in control, seemingly dictating the terms of the purchase. Some customers therefore feel obligated to make a purchase as a way to regain control of the transaction and the interaction.</p>
<p><strong>Rude embrace?</strong><br />While rude service may work in the short-term, it does not support beneficial long-term customer relationships.</p>
<p>The pressure created by the tactic works in-store, and in the moment, but alienates customers in the long run &ndash; a perspective acknowledged by the study which noted that customers who expressed increased desire to purchase the luxury products reported significantly diminished desire only two weeks later.</p>
<p>A better alternative is to create engaged, personalized customer service that is linked to a strategic loyalty program. This sets the table for long-term customer relationships, particularly in the luxury segment.</p>
<p>Loyalty programs generate customer profile information and transaction data that offer salespeople valuable insights. These insights can translate to tailored customer experiences <a href=""/loyalty-services/loyalty-strategy-and-design/"" target=""_blank"">using clienteling practices</a>.</p>
<p>Better engagement contributes to an improved overall shopping experience, encouraging additional purchases and repeat business.</p>
<p>In the meantime, constructive insights from this study can inform luxury retailers&rsquo; broader loyalty strategies:</p>
<p>&bull; <strong>Embrace the aspirational value of status.</strong> Although the salesperson temporarily captures the dominant status through rude behavior, this is not sustainable over time.</p>
<p>Customers will return to retail settings where they feel comfortable and their status is appropriately recognized. <br />Be sure status indicators, either in a formal program or through unpublished CRM actions, are aligned to customer value.</p>
<p>Conveying higher status to customers on a short-term basis is highly effective. As numerous successful campaigns have demonstrated, members will work harder to keep status than earn it the first time.</p>
<p>&bull; <strong>Cede some control to the customers.</strong> Program elements, especially rewards and redemption, provide another vehicle for customers to exercise their control.</p>
<p>Allowing members to choose special days to earn accelerated rewards, determining which forms of recognition are meaningful to them, and providing greater selection of benefits without major sacrifices to the simplicity of your loyalty strategy are all well tested approaches that drive greater customer spend over time.</p>
<p>Membership should surround customers with the sense of belonging and perceived benefit, as well as generating a vested interest in the brand.</p>
<p>&bull; <strong>Leverage the power of the sales associate.</strong> In-store personnel have the most direct and critical connection to customers and nothing can replace the face-to-face, personal interaction that they provide. Period. They are more effective than points and can create or destroy more value than any published loyalty program.</p>
<p>Successful loyalty strategies leverage associates and their skills, giving them the tools to enhance long-term customer relationships. Unfortunately, this is one of the most commonly overlooked aspects of loyalty strategy across the retail sector.</p>
<p><strong>LONG-TERM CUSTOMER relationships</strong> in the luxury retail segment should be built with engaged associates providing personalized service, <a href=""/research-insights/case-studies/new-strategic-direction-for-iconic-loyalty-program"" target=""_blank"">linked to a strategic loyalty rewards program</a>. The experience for both customers and retailers will be far sweeter and the long term results much better.</p>",,,,,,SYSTEM_HOST,,1

We like games, we like our phones, and we like being winners. We also are looking for purpose and meaning and how we can make a difference. Mobile gamification for charitable causes can give us what we need.</p>
<p>And it doesn&rsquo;t have to be complicated or expensive either. Instead of building a game from scratch, charities should look to a corporate partner to co-create the solution. One example is mobile game developer XEOPlay who created&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.tiltworld.com/about.html"" target=""_blank"">Tilt World</a>, a game that helps to reforest Madagascar. Points earned in the game translate to tree seeds purchased for and on behalf of the tree-planting charity WeForest.

Another example is&nbsp;<a href=""http://zynga.org/results/games-for-good/"" target=""_blank"">Games for Good</a>, who donates a fraction of a cent to charity every time you play their games.

<p>AIR MILES for Social Change has been partnering with different charities for the past 4 years by using reward miles as a carrot to increase giving and engagement with nonprofits. We infused gamification and behavioural economics motivational concepts into these initiatives with good success and have learned a lot in the process. Here is a list of top 5 lessons we&rsquo;ve observed on how charities can best engage with today&rsquo;s donor:</p>
<ol>
<li>People give to be personally recognized, not necessarily because they are emotionally connected to the cause:&nbsp;People like to be seen giving &ndash; in fact for many nowadays this is the main reason they give. They want their peers to see the good they have done, and some are defining their giving as a social measure of their personal success. So a tax receipt and thank you letter just aren&rsquo;t enough anymore. Charities need to make sure that they are giving the types of recognition that people want today, and often social media recognition to the most cost-effective tool to use.</li>
<li>People give to support their friends vs the cause more than ever:&nbsp;Fundraisers where donors reach out to their network have been around for years. These programs are generally more successful because people like to support their friends. The next evolution of fundraising is in driving more value from peer-to-peer donor networks. Crowdfunding is exploding. See the amazing success of pooling platforms such as Kickstarter, Indiegogo and Causevox. Charities should piggyback off of these platforms and capitalize on their popularity.</li>
<li>People want frequent touch points of thanks and celebration for their giving: Social media has trained us all to expect frequent virtual hugs and celebration by way of badges, trophies, congratulations and thank yous. We want to be told all the time how good we are. Rightly or wrongly, these are the new table stakes and charities need to give this recognition and appreciation to their donors more frequently. The thanks and recognition can be small, fleeting, and inexpensive to deliver at a regular cadence via social media.</li>
<li>People want experiences to be social and fun:&nbsp;Gamification is one way to do this, as well as events where donors can be active participants, plus consumer-led social media movements like the Ice Bucket Challenge. Although movements are a fleeting and time-limited way to fundraise, the way that people engaged with the Ice Bucket campaign is different than ever before. Making giving into a game has proven to be a great way to engage a high number of people across multiple demographics and regions, and is an emerging trend that charities can&rsquo;t afford to ignore.</li>
<li>Youth want to make a difference hands-on:&nbsp;Youth want to tangibly experience the difference they are making, and just making a donation to an organization to do the work for them doesn&rsquo;t suffice for this cohort. They want to donate their time, energy, spirit and dollars to grassroots organizations, and the most successful programs are going to be led by youth. See the popularity of giving initiatives such as community Giving Days, or&nbsp;<a href=""http://globalextrovert.com/more-on-my-new-favorite-word/"" target=""_blank"">PhilanthroTeens</a>.&rdquo; In addition to the hands-on experience, youth want to be able to share their experiences with others.&nbsp; Social media and games are the best way to engage the new youth donor segment.</li>
</ol>
<p>The other key success factor is of course, mobile. People love their phones and the more they can do with their phones the more they will engage with your brand and the cause.</p>
<p>A megatrend of our time is that people are actively looking for new and impactful ways to make a difference. Charities offer up all the things we are looking for but they need to proactively shake up the way giving is done today. Gamification, crowdfunding and behavioural economics will be three key elements for successful, fun and rewarding giving programs of the future.</p>",,,,,,SYSTEM_HOST,,0

<p>The way out of this mess? Relevance. I define relevance as the effective use of customer data to outline your goals and tactics &ndash; all through the lens of improving the customer benefit. It's not cost effective to orchestrate&nbsp;<em>every</em>&nbsp;touch point with a customer, and that's a traditional definition of relevance we need to overcome in order to make the most out of data.</p>
<p>The biggest barrier to relevance &mdash; and to meeting rising customer expectations to deliver more meaningful interactions&mdash; is the customer data that companies are using to make decisions about context, message, time, and channel.</p>
<p>Chances are good that too little data isn't the problem. Your company is probably swimming in information. Many companies are collecting too much data in an unstructured way, so that processing the information is overwhelming.</p>
<p>So the question is: <a href=""/research-insights/articles/data-get-it-right-not-big"" target=""_blank"">Are you collecting the&nbsp;<em>right</em>&nbsp;data</a>?</p>
<p>Here are three steps to getting to ""yes"":</p>
<p><strong>Define the business objective:&nbsp;</strong>Data should align with a strategy, and the best way to sync up information with needs is to articulate the outcome of your strategy: what is the objective, what is the timeline, who is the target group and what is the goal for that segment?&nbsp;<br />With each group and strategy, consider working through these points:</p>
<ul>
<li>What's the fewest number of data types needed to solve for the business objectives?</li>
<li>What data is table stakes verses 'nice to have'?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Decide on a tactic and choose the correct data points:&nbsp;</strong>What constitutes correct or ""best"" data will depend on which customer group you're targeting. You need to understand the targets' current behaviours and stay focused on consumer benefit. For instance, when considering a hold strategy for best customers, the tactic could be to target them with access and recognition to make them feel more important and appreciated. To do that would require, at minimum, four data types:</p>
<ul>
<li>Demographic</li>
<li>Transactional</li>
<li>Redemption mix</li>
<li>Lifestyle</li>
</ul>
<p>On the other hand, if you're looking at a growth strategy for near-best customers, that tactic could be to target them with offers for cross-sell and upsell opportunities to increase spend. This would require two of the same data types: demographic and transactional, as well as two different ones: communication preferences and past campaign response behaviour.</p>
<p><strong>Implement efficient collection and delivery:&nbsp;</strong>How will you collect the data and deliver insights? ""Right-sizing"" a data set means optimizing the data and then collecting clean material. These are done by 1) collecting the right data to support goals and tactics 2)&nbsp; updating data frequently enough to support&nbsp; objectives, and 3) maintaining hygiene of the dataset -- keeping what's needed to achieve goals, and storing outdated data in a data warehouse. Data sets include contact data, marketing data and transaction data. They're collected whenever a customer opens an email, comes to your website, uses the app, or pays by credit card.</p>
<p>If you keep customer benefit top of mind and define your objectives prior to data collection, and remember &ndash; more data isn't always better &ndash; you are on the right path to <a href=""/research-insights/case-studies/delivering-relevance-with-loyalty-data"" target=""_blank"">delivering&nbsp;</a><em><a href=""/research-insights/case-studies/delivering-relevance-with-loyalty-data"" target=""_blank"">relevance</a>&nbsp;</em>to your valued customers.</p>",,,,,,SYSTEM_HOST,,1

<p>I&rsquo;ve broken down the top five reasons why outsourcing data analytics can make more sense than having it in-house:</p>
<p><strong>1. Cost and Time Savings</strong><br />Outsourcing makes sense for cutting upfront costs and reducing employee workload. Your upfront investment is minimal as operations do not need to be setup in-house and your company only pays for the cost of production, maintenance and improvements. As a result, the financial barriers to entry are lowered. You&rsquo;ll likely see that the investment quickly pays for itself through higher sales and profits derived from smarter decisions based on analytics.</p>
<p>There is a known theory called the &ldquo;experience curve,&rdquo; examined and popularized by the Boston Consulting Group in the 1960s. The theory says that an organization reduces its cost by 25% every time it doubles its production. The concept is still valid with data analytics. As a data analytics company increases production, it learns how to better use its software and how to standardize and optimize processes.</p>
<p>Economies of scale due to pooling also mean that outsourced retail analytics cost less and take less time than the same analytics performed in-house, particularly for low-level or repetitive tasks.</p>
<p><strong>2. Talented Data Scientists and Data Analysts</strong><br />It&rsquo;s a well-known fact that it is hard to find talented data scientists and analysts who actually understand your business. By looking outside of your own company walls and reaching out to specialized data analytics companies, you&rsquo;ll have immediate access to some of the best and brightest data scientists and analysts that have worked on projects with similar requirements as yours.</p>
<p>When you outsource your data analytics, you don&rsquo;t have to spend time recruiting, hiring, training, and housing employees for short-term projects. There is also the issue of internal resources of your company not having the capacity to globalize your company&rsquo;s business. Outsourcing your retail data analytics will bring the scale and dimensions required in data analytics to manage that aspect of your business worldwide.</p>
<p><strong>3. Focused Strategy with Flexible Operations</strong><br />Outsourcing your retail data analytics means that your company can focus on its primary business strategy &mdash; to have a competitive advantage &mdash; rather than getting bogged down in secondary strategies to build out retail analytics capabilities and processes. Focusing on your core competencies sets you up for success as you&rsquo;re spending more time putting into action new insights from your data analytics partner with predictably successful outcomes.<img src=""/dotAsset/1b742d59-a50d-455f-b13b-66e36d2e082e.jpg"" width=""275"" height=""275"" alt=""Outsourcing your retail data analytics means that your company can focus on its primary business strategy"" title=""Outsourcing your retail data analytics means that your company can focus on its primary business strategy"" style=""float: left; margin: 1px 0px;"" /></p>
<p>Another secondary benefit is that while you&rsquo;re focused on your business strategy, you can rest assured that your retail analytics partner is focused on how best to serve your business needs. It is currently a buyers&rsquo; market for retailers, and because of this, many analytics partners have very flexible engagement models that allow them to adapt and customize for new retail business challenges as they arise.</p>
<p><strong>4. Keeping Up with Technological Advances</strong><br />It&rsquo;s no secret that technology is quickly evolving around the world in every industry. Grocers striving to gain a competitive advantage by using the latest in technology, especially in areas outside of their everyday expertise such as data analytics, are far better off outsourcing to fulfill those technological needs. Companies dedicated to providing data analytics platforms and services are continuously making large-scale investments to update their toolsets, ensuring they stay competitive by providing retail clients with the best solutions and tools available.</p>
<p><strong>5. Improved Risk Mitigation, Compliance and Accuracy</strong><br />Outsourcing your retail data analytics means that you can depend on existing best practices and compliance systems that reduce human error and follow-ups. Outsourced data analytics will also improve work accuracy in terms of given deadlines on projects because of strict contractual agreements with your data analytics partner.</p>
<p>Of course you can further mitigate risks by choosing a data analytics partner that has a proven platform and project management process, saving your company from the inherent risks of trying to develop, maintain and improve upon these for the first time internally.</p>
<p>Outsourcing large parts of your data analytics not only reduces your internal costs, it reduces risk and allows your company to focus on its core competencies. In our fast moving technological world, it is unlikely that your company will be able to efficiently design, manage and continuously improve upon a whole spectrum of retail analytics platforms and processes needed to see increased sales and profits.</p>",,,,,,SYSTEM_HOST,,1

<p>When eBay first made its debut in 1995, many predicted it would fail simply because people would be wary about buying items from a complete stranger over the Internet. Nineteen years, 112 million users, and $16 billion later, that prediction has been debunked. Now, people are doing more than buying and selling through P2P connections. They are opening their houses and cars to strangers, funding start-ups, and even designing products for Fortune 1000 companies.</p>
<p>In short, what consumers do via P2P, and who they do business with, are both expanding rapidly. Consumers in the P2P world are conducting business directly with each other as individuals, rather than with companies. They are also sharing recommendations, helping each other to navigate purchase decisions, and solving each other&rsquo;s specific problems without direct contact with business entities.</p>
<p>As more P2P businesses become successful, they challenge the idea that business is solely a structured retailer/customer endeavor. The newest players in this economy are presenting solutions that are project-based, social-media dependent, and dependent on engagement and trust to succeed. Customers increasingly expect these features &ndash; and are increasingly abandoning businesses that do not provide them.</p>
<p><strong>P2P Makes Room for Business</strong><br />The new P2P economy suggests that more and more transactions will have corporations involved merely as a facilitator between independent parties. But they may not even have that leverage, as many P2P sites are run by non-corporate entities. The reality is that there are two types of corporations emerging: Those which ignore P2P networks and thereby endanger their own relevance, and those that embrace P2P networks as solutions to bolster trust and scale niche solutions.</p>
<p>One powerful example of embracing P2P networks is crowdsourcing traditional business functions. Crowdsourcing is a model whereby a company outsources some functions to a wide number of targeted individuals, reducing costs and improving results. Crowdsourcing is growing in several areas:</p>
<p><em><strong>Funding:</strong></em> Indiegogo lets anyone set up and promote a project to be funded. With Indiegogo, an entrepreneur or project manager can avoid having to persuade investors or grant-lending institutions to supply money, and instead tap a crowd of smaller angel investors interested in seeing the project come to fruition. Now Indiegogo also lets established brands tap into their own networks by providing funding apps that can integrate with the brand&rsquo;s existing website. This means that many business ventures will be shorter-term projects, promoted by social media and funded by a crowd of engaged parties &ndash; people who will want to be apprised of the project&rsquo;s progress and ultimately be the brand ambassadors for the results.</p>
<p><em><strong>Product Development:</strong></em> When Fiat Brazil began design of the Fiat Mio, it wanted a design that would be modern, but also popular. Rather turning over this task to its engineers, Fiat crowdsourced the design. Anyone could visit the specially branded website and give design suggestions, and the site itself was promoted through a viral marketing campaign. The final design for the Fiat Mio included around 10,000 suggestions from users in more than 160 countries &ndash; extensive input and social engagement for a single project.</p>
<p><em><strong>Marketing Research:</strong></em> Businesses are comfortable with the idea of getting insights from a crowd &ndash; in the form of a poll or focus group. But the real innovation comes from repeated interaction with a targeted group, and allowing their input to develop and enhance team insights, focus branding efforts, and drive product innovation. Canada-based Chaordix uses proprietary technology to do these things, allowing major brands to collaborate with customers (and potential customers) online.</p>
<p><strong>Loyalty, P2P Style</strong><br />P2P networks (and social networks in general) have moved into the loyalty sphere as well. Loyalty is, first and foremost, about relationship with customers. The loyalty programs of the future will leverage customers&rsquo; own social networks, crowdsourcing many of the functions of a typical loyalty program. And this will cause consumers to expect the kind of social validation and scaling that is driving P2P solutions in the first place.<img src=""/dotAsset/4f3b133e-2f3c-471d-9525-cdbbc88aed1d.jpg"" width=""270"" height=""164"" alt=""P2P networks (and social networks in general) have moved into the loyalty sphere as well."" title=""P2P networks (and social networks in general) have moved into the loyalty sphere as well."" style=""float: left; margin: 3px;"" /></p>
<p>One example of an emerging P2P loyalty program is MoPals. Founder and CEO Alex Haditaghi explains its underlying mission: ""MoPals aims to disrupt loyalty in the start-up community by bringing innovation, transparency, and community to the industry.""</p>
<p>Customers who sign up for MoPals earn reward points, called MoCoins, for activity on social media and reviewing websites. For example, customers can check in when they arrive at a store, post a review of a restaurant, share an offer, or simply &ldquo;like&rdquo; a page or brand on social media. MoCoins can then be redeemed for a wide range of rewards.</p>
<p>The P2P angle is that customers themselves can recruit their favorite businesses to take part in the program. Customers also drive more consumer participation as they share over social media and recruit their friends and contacts to sign up. This means that program adoption is driven just as much by members as it is by any corporate marketing team.</p>
<p>For merchants, MoPals helps to generate social media influence and buzz. Customers who have had positive interactions with the business have an incentive to share their experiences with their social network, in essence becoming brand ambassadors in their circles.</p>
<p>P2P projects are adding validation, trust, and scale to niche solutions, which means that their prevalence will grow, and consumers will come to rely on them more. In response, businesses will have to adapt their loyalty offerings using P2P elements to add validation, build trust, and scale solutions to consumers&rsquo; actual needs. Otherwise, consumers will simply work around that business instead of with it. Companies with the old &ldquo;us vs them&rdquo; mentality are already becoming obsolete.</p>",,,,,,SYSTEM_HOST,,0

But customers are quickly donning Web-enabled watches, jackets and glasses, and it is time for forward-thinking companies to start experimenting.</p>
<p>From a loyalty perspective, we are fast approaching a tipping point: We already know that loyalty initiatives should be optimized for mobile devices, but we are at the exciting early stage of learning how loyalty can intersect with mobile as it branches out beyond the rectangular phone.<img src=""/dotAsset/8de17f6c-1b6e-4a78-9fbf-0d321f079c6b.jpg"" width=""250"" height=""250"" alt=""Wearables are the new loyalty frontier"" title=""Wearables are the new loyalty frontier"" style=""float: right; margin-top: 2px; margin-bottom: 2px;"" /></p>
<p><b>Helping hand.&nbsp;</b>My prediction is that wearables will take over helping consumers shop, purchase and share, and so loyalty must embrace them sooner or later.</p>
<p>Wearables certainly have momentum. More than 2 million smartwatches, rigged to send and receive email and tweets, get the weather and run select applications, were sold worldwide in 2013.</p>
<p>Android is advancing that ball: it previewed a new operating system called Wear in March that adds navigation, scannable tickets for travel and Siri-like voice recognition to the wrist device.</p>
<p>GoPro alone sold 2.3 million of its wearable cameras in 2012. And Google Glass has been creeping into the public eye, first with an exclusive beta audience speculated at 10,000 and then a much ballyhooed launch to the general public in May.</p>
<p>I am sure that most brands will not see a significant portion of their customers sporting one of these devices this year, but that is exactly why now is the time to experiment.</p>
<p>Here is where I see opportunities:</p>
<p><b>Fitness trackers are leading the way.&nbsp;</b>Industries such as sport and wellness already have a critical mass of customers using simple wearables that monitor a user&rsquo;s vitals and overall activity.</p>
<p>The U.S. digital fitness category, with tech product leaders such as Fitbits and Nike Fuelbands, was worth $330 million in 2013.</p>
<p>Activity tracking is proving to be a rich incentives area for customers.</p>
<p>Walgreens Steps, which is approaching a year in market, has more than 1.3 million active program members tracking their physical activities and earning points for their healthy choices in its Balance Rewards program. Members receive extra points when they connect an app or device to the program.</p>
<p>Alfa Bank, a leading privately owned bank in Russia, is rewarding its loyal savings customers who exercise with premium interest rates &mdash; customers can literally build their finances <a href=""http://vimeo.com/93142574"" target=""_blank"">through sweat equity</a>.</p>
<p><b><img src=""/dotAsset/916bc30e-7c96-4ca3-acfd-33fd0be802ac.jpg"" width=""200"" height=""200"" alt=""Brands with more progressive, tech-savvy customers know it will not be long before more customers will want to make purchases with their watches or glasses."" title=""Brands with more progressive, tech-savvy customers know it will not be long before more customers will want to make purchases with their watches or glasses."" style=""float: left; margin-top: 2px; margin-bottom: 2px;"" />Omnichannel loyalty programs have a leg-up.&nbsp;</b>Brands with more progressive, tech-savvy customers know it will not be long before more customers will want to make purchases with their watches or glasses.</p>
<p>That will demand responsive Web sites that are optimized for all types of mobile devices, including wearables. And loyalty programs that already reward and incentivize purchases and activity from mobile devices &ndash; and that collect data to better understand those customers who use mobile &ndash; will find it easier to integrate activity from wearables.</p>
<p>The earlier that brands experiment with serving up information on wearables and rewarding activity on them, the more they will learn in a lower-stakes beta environment. That means they will be better prepared to support the next wave of customers who will be less forgiving and expect a seamless experience.</p>

<p>Compounding this slowing growth, the luxury landscape has become increasingly crowded as retailers seek new ways to differentiate themselves from entry-level competitors that are rapidly capturing market share. Luxury retailers need to quickly re-examine their customer loyalty strategies to ensure that they are as sophisticated and effective as the other areas of the customer experience.</p>
<p>Why have luxury marketers lagged in adopting loyalty?</p>
<p><strong>Class of its own<br /></strong>One of the myths regarding loyalty and luxury customers is that this audience does not value rewards because its wealth is inherited, and they are indifferent to price and loyalty strategies.</p>
<p><img src=""/dotAsset/7c343a65-b1d6-44fa-a341-cb448d2e41df.jpg"" width=""250"" height=""168"" alt=""Creating an effective loyalty strategy for luxury brands"" title=""Creating an effective loyalty strategy for luxury brands"" style=""float: right; margin-top: 4px; margin-bottom: 4px;"" /></p>
<p>Studies by the Harrison Group, as well as other researchers, confirm most luxury consumers today come from entrepreneurial wealth and middle class backgrounds. These newly affluent customers tend to reflect their middle class values in their buying behavior &ndash; and in their attitude toward customer loyalty programs.</p>
<p>Another myth says that rewards strategies are too down-market, using broad-based consumer appeals that do not apply to high-end clientele. While affluent consumers have high expectations of elevated service levels, preferential treatment and insider access, they also consistently rank rewards at the top of attractive elements of a loyalty program in research.</p>
<p>Loyalty initiatives should integrate exemplary customer service with promotions, bundling soft benefits with hard rewards. In fact, the luxury market is at a tipping point in terms of openness to loyalty initiatives not just for brands, but for retailers. Department store chain Bloomingdale&rsquo;s has established a case for a more inclusive program. The &ldquo;Loyallist&rdquo; initiative, established in 2012, now has a successful track record as a multi-tier, points-based program.</p>
<p>The retailer has increased member participation and average spend as well as captured greater amounts of customer data for enhancing marketing efforts. Cosmetics marketer Lancome recently unveiled Elite Rewards, designed to increase customer acquisition and retention, with an emphasis on social media and content promotion. The structure of the program helps Lancome establish direct relationships with customers. More efforts are expected to launch shortly.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the question for luxury marketers is not &ldquo;Is loyalty important to us?&rdquo; but rather, &ldquo;How can this approach best be used to amplify our brand in the market?&rdquo;</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Three&rsquo;s the charm<br /></strong>Here are some initial steps for creating a successful loyalty strategy in the luxury segment:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;<strong>Do not approach loyalty as a program</strong>, but as an overall customer relationship enhancement strategy.</p>
<p>It is a mistake to launch a loyalty initiative as you would a marketing program. Instead, it should be part of the holistic marketing mix: consider loyalty along with pricing, merchandising, customer experience and promotions.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;<strong>Align with employees.</strong>&nbsp;Especially in a retail setting, make sure the loyalty initiative provides strategic tools for floor associates that are highly branded and relationship based.</p>
<p>Monitor and collect feedback to refine the tools and the clienteling process. Employee buy-in is crucial: if they do not embrace it, customers will not.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;<strong>Go beyond the traditional models.</strong>&nbsp;There is no reason that luxury brands or retailers should be constrained by old formats or paradigms such as tiers or points.</p>
<p>Design an integrated, elegant strategy that provides the customized customer experience that results in long-term loyalty.</p>
<p>MARKETERS NEED TO leverage the flexibility inherent in loyalty programs and design them to be as unique and aspirational as the brands they represent. With those guidelines in mind, brands that engage their customers with premium products, exemplary customer service and well-architected loyalty strategies will expand their market share in the increasingly competitive luxury marketplace.</p>",,,,,,SYSTEM_HOST,,0

<p><strong>What makes a winner?</strong></p>
<p>Earlier this summer, the Food Marketing Institute (FMI) announced its annual Store Manager Awards, which recognize grocery managers for their work in store operations, leadership, and community involvement.&nbsp;One of the finalists, Doug Malenoski, Manager of a King Soopers (a division of The Kroger Co.) in Littleton, Colorado, said that what was critical to him was &ldquo;communication and the sharing of key data, results and success.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Data, he said, is what empowers his team to offer creative suggestions and solve problems on the floor.</p>
<p>Malenoski has it exactly right.</p>
<p><img src=""/dotAsset/a39a6f01-5e13-4a1b-afa5-3fe90699e860.jpg"" width=""200"" height=""133"" alt=""Make sure your front-line managers have the info they need to make more confident and effective decisions"" title=""Make sure your front-line managers have the info they need to make more confident and effective decisions"" style=""float: right; margin: 0px; border: 2px solid black;"" /></p>
<p>Customer data and insights should be shared across the organization to ensure grocer success, and that means not overlooking store managers. Informing store managers with insights from store-level customer data &mdash; including the pricing, assortment and promotion decisions based on customer data &mdash; is what allows front-line managers to be more confident and effective in their decision-making.</p>
<p>Take assortment, for example. In today&rsquo;s environment, retailers are driving towards efficient and differentiated assortments with head-office decisions. Enabling store managers to identify which categories have local needs &mdash;and, from there, which items are most important, unique, and differentiated to their customers &mdash; can enable a manageable level of localized assortment while still meeting corporate goals. Customer data is what allows managers at the store level to better understand and accept corporate decisions while making better decisions themselves.</p>
<p>Whether we&rsquo;re talking about a small, individually-owned grocery store or one that is part of a larger chain, managing a grocery store successfully involves considerable responsibility. Grocery store managers must ensure that the store operations run smoothly, that items are stocked and priced competitively, and that customers are satisfied. Incorporating data insights maximizes the chances of success.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s one thing to say that store-level customer insights should be shared, and another to know how to do it.</p>
<p>The challenge is to make sense of the avalanche of information. Store managers have to handle insights coming from many disparate systems, including any number of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Delivery and inventory systems</strong>, such as direct store delivery systems, order entry/inventory management&nbsp;systems, shelf space management&nbsp;systems, and item price verification tools.</li>
<li><strong>In-store display systems</strong>, such as shelf tags/sign systems, electronic kiosks, and electronic shelf labels.</li>
<li><strong>Checkout systems</strong>, such as POS checkout systems and self-checkout systems.</li>
<li><strong>Finance systems</strong>, such as cash management systems, loss prevention&nbsp;auditing systems, and financial forecasting systems.</li>
</ul>
<p>To truly take advantage of the benefits of sharing store-level customer insights across an organization, companies need to focus on data and insights system integration. Understanding data enough to make it actionable is what makes the store environment more profitable.</p>
<p><img src=""/dotAsset/521815ae-d4dd-41e5-b980-58b837d69d1b.jpg"" width=""200"" height=""133"" alt=""Once an integrated system is in place, an organization is ready to provide one convenient point of access to store managers."" title=""Once an integrated system is in place, an organization is ready to provide one convenient point of access to store managers."" style=""border: 2px solid black; float: left;"" /></p>
<p>Once an integrated system is in place, an organization is ready to provide one convenient point of access to store managers.</p>
<p>Stores could even take a lesson from Supervalu, which in 2012 handed out to its store directors 2,200 iPads that were loaded with productivity tools they could access right on the store floor.</p>
<p>Grocery industry veterans know that focusing on best customers is key to successful growth. Leading grocers are already thinking about how best to integrate systems data and insights and how best to share those data and insights with front-line managers.</p>
<p>Bottom line: It&rsquo;s fast becoming table stakes to gather and process data. What will separate the winners from the rest of the pack is how well that data gets into the hands of the people who most need it.</p>",,,,,,SYSTEM_HOST,,1

But will customers embrace it?,"<p>Pre-purchase identification is becoming increasingly prevalent in the retail space. But will customers embrace it?&nbsp;<br /><br />Historically, customers were most often identified after they made a purchase, when they used their credit card or presented a loyalty card. But post-purchase identification doesn&rsquo;t allow marketers to create a relevant or personalized in-store experience while customers are shopping.&nbsp;<br /><br />Retailers who know immediately who a high-value customer is as he or she walks into a store can treat them appropriately. We&rsquo;re seeing fast advancement in this direction:<br /><br /><strong>&ldquo;Check-ins&rdquo; led the way</strong>&nbsp;-- Foursquare, and then Facebook and Yelp, encouraged customers to check-in when they entered a shop, and retailers responded with incentives from free products to free valet parking. Foursquare even encourages retailers to use the service to build loyalty, providing suggestions at its website for how to build special deals and rewards into check-in. This was the first iteration of pre-purchase identification.<br /><br /><strong>Beacons and GPS location are now growing in popularity</strong>&nbsp;-- As my colleague Brian Ross notes in his recent article &ldquo;<a href=""/research-insights/blog/beacons-the-next-step-toward-customer-personalization"" target=""_blank"">Beacons: The Next Step Toward Customer Personalization</a>?&rdquo;, a growing number of high-profile retailers have installed hardware in their stores that will trigger apps to send real-time offers and content to shoppers.<br /><br />The future, though, is to delve into methods that have the potential to be off-putting to customers: to move into facial recognition. Here are two points to consider:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Software such as Facebook&rsquo;s new &ldquo;DeepFace&rdquo; is improving the power of facial recognition.</strong>&nbsp;DeepFace, for instance, can identify faces with 97.25% accuracy. Facebook already has an algorithm in place that looks at uploaded photos, analyzes them, and then proposes tags if it recognizes the faces from a user&rsquo;s group of friends. (This can be creepy the first few times it happens.) DeepFace technology will improve that identification further, and it&rsquo;s only a matter of time before this technology moves offline into retail settings as customers move from shop to shop.</li>
<li><strong>Facial recognition is starting to be used in the retail environment.</strong>&nbsp;The U.K. retailer Tesco is introducing screens that scan faces and will deliver demographically targeted ads at its 450 gas stations. The technology is called OptimEyes and comes from the London-based company Amscreen. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re always looking to work with partners who provide innovative ways to enhance the customer shopping experience,&rdquo; said the category director for Tesco gas stations in a press release.</li>
</ol>
<p>The big question is whether customers will find facial recognition valuable or creepy. Real-time and extremely personalized offers are alluring, but companies have to know what customers want and what they won&rsquo;t tolerate. Companies that explore this route will want to make it easy for customers to opt in or opt out. Customers are more likely to opt in if they see value in the program. As long as a program offers something relevant, customers are more likely to embrace this new technology.</p>",,,,,,SYSTEM_HOST,,0

<p>I was not necessarily looking to make a move to Canada, but the opportunity presented itself and once I&rsquo;d started down that path, I didn&rsquo;t look back. The beauty of marketing is that the skills transcend borders. Having worked here for a little more than two years, I can say that from a marketing perspective, Canada has the opportunity to lead the pack in terms of social media. We are reportedly one of the most mobile-ready and socially connected countries in the world, but companies need to be better about tapping into the opportunities that presents.</p>
<p>We still see some big multinational brands repurpose their campaigns in Canada from other markets. However, we&rsquo;re starting to see a shift, putting the creative thinking into the hands of Canadians and embracing Canada&rsquo;s unique cultural make-up.</p>
<p>Canada&rsquo;s marketing future is bright and it&rsquo;s exciting to see that there&rsquo;s a shift to challenge the tried and true mainstays of traditional thinking. Canada can and should market &ldquo;in the fast lane.&rdquo; We&rsquo;re getting there and I&rsquo;m happy to be along for the ride.</p>",,,,,,SYSTEM_HOST,,0

<p>Online grocery has been around a while, but recent changes in online shopping behaviour, shipping speed, and competitive offerings have this space primed for continued growth.</p>
<p>As more grocery spend moves online, loyalty marketers and merchandisers will have new and valuable opportunities to learn more than ever before about their shoppers.&nbsp;<img src=""/dotAsset/90d231fe-c8d0-4f96-ad99-3ee418ebcf2d.jpg"" width=""200"" height=""167"" alt=""With more grocery spend going online, marketers can learn more about their shoppers than ever before"" title=""With more grocery spend going online, marketers can learn more about their shoppers than ever before"" style=""float: right; margin: 2px 0px;"" /></p>
<p>Information that was previously unavailable in a brick-and-mortar setting will suddenly be accessible for deep analytical rigor.</p>
<p>For Canadian grocers who already have a loyalty program, new data from online activity will join with the information they&rsquo;ve been able to gather in-store all along, opening new opportunities for gathering meaningful insights from customer data.</p>
<p>From where I sit, here are three of the biggest analytical insights that grocers can obtain by adding an online platform:</p>
<p><strong>Broader knowledge of customer behaviour.</strong> Grocers offering online services will be able to track browsing in ways that were previously the sole purvey of e-tailers. They&rsquo;ll be able to see what customers browse, what goes into a basket &ndash; and what didn&rsquo;t. Knowing what customers decided not to buy can be just as powerful as what they did. While loyalty programs, in-store camera systems, and the upcoming use of BLE Beacons will all help shed more light on customers in brick-and-mortar stores, online grocery interactions provide even deeper customer-specific data sets, enabling grocers to greater influence the purchase decision at the moment of truth. What&rsquo;s more, the tools to harness, depict, and analyze this online information &ndash; primarily real-time analytics and integration of purchase history, customer insights and online behavioural models &ndash; are already very advanced.</p>
<p><strong>Richer data.</strong> Data will reveal what customers buy online and, if they&rsquo;re a member of a loyalty program, what they also buy in store. Loyalty programs, memberships clubs, and discount/points programs today provide the platform for understanding customer purchases in-store, but the data set will be that much richer when online behaviour is woven in. Grocers will have the ability to form a comprehensive and detailed customer profile. The same can&rsquo;t be said for the slew of new competitors entering this space &ndash; including Amazon &ndash; that simply don&rsquo;t have a competitive handle on their customers&rsquo; in-store grocery history.</p>
<p><strong>Understanding social and satisfaction in ways never before possible.</strong> As grocery spend migrates online and traffic moves through online sites, grocers will see a big uptick in the quantity of unstructured social data. Shoppers will begin more actively reviewing items, sharing recipes and products in their circles, and taking to social networks to engage with the companies they do business with (in good times and in bad). This is a tremendous opportunity for two-way dialogue and learning for an industry that&rsquo;s historically been driven by push marketing and reliant on spend data, focus groups, and surveys.</p>
<p>While most online retailers don&rsquo;t have the luxury of tallying frequent purchases, and therefore have to extrapolate on occasional small orders and visits, grocery is the opposite.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s frequent, and order sizes contain more items. These factors make the insights gained by predictive analytics much more accurate in the grocery sector.</p>
<p>In sum, grocery is no longer immune to the omni-channel challenge that other retailers have been addressing for the past few years.</p>
<p>The light at the end of the tunnel is that this industry is ideally positioned to help grocers learn much more about their customers, which should allow savvy retailers to serve their customers even better.</p>",,,,,,SYSTEM_HOST,,1

<p>These are among the findings of the April report&nbsp;<a title=""Fears for Tiers: 2014 COLLOQUY Study on Membership Status in Loyalty Programs"" href=""http://colloquy.uberflip.com/i/300114/2"" target=""_blank"">Fears for Tiers: 2014 COLLOQUY Study on Membership Status In Loyalty Programs</a>. Based on a February survey of 3,077 U.S. and Canadian consumers, the study finds that the traditional three-tier loyalty structure is actually creating confusion among some members, not fostering loyalty.</p>
<p>For example, 80 percent of those members in the bottom tiers are discouraged by the requirements needed to achieve top-tier status; it just seems too difficult. One-third of lower-tier members do not think they are properly acknowledged, even though they participate in their programs often.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The traditional tiered rewards system is an outdated solution to the ongoing challenge&nbsp;of maintaining customer engagement,&rdquo; the report states.</p>
<p>Among the other findings:</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">&bull;&nbsp;50 percent of respondents said they increased spending or changed purchasing behavior to achieve a higher tier status.</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">&bull;&nbsp;Non-travel program members are more than twice as likely as those in travel programs to be unsure of their tier level (34 percent to 16 percent).</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">&bull;&nbsp;The positive feeling associated with reaching a higher tier status is stronger among men (39 percent) than women (33 percent).</p>
<p>Why the lack of engagement? In part it&rsquo;s because loyalty operators, in their effort to be relevant, keep tweaking their tier structures. These changes threaten the member&rsquo;s motivation to pursue a higher tier, and results in less participation. Sure, half of those surveyed said they spent more to reach a higher tier, but half of them have not done anything. Of the 50 percent who did, the most likely method was purchasing products or services that offered &ldquo;bonus&rdquo; points or miles (22 percent).</p>
<p>Fortunately, loyalty marketers do have a map to their own brass ring &ndash; the highly engaged consumer &ndash; and it follows a pretty straightforward path. According to the report:</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;""><strong>1.</strong>&nbsp;Keep the benefits simple and clear cut;</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;""><strong>2.</strong>&nbsp;Stop changing lanes &ndash; choose an earnings structure and stick with it;</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;""><strong>3.</strong>&nbsp;Educate members with easy-to-understand guidelines of program requirements and what they need to do to reach the next tier;</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;""><strong>4.</strong>&nbsp;Recognize consumers based on what motivates them, not on transaction values; and</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;""><strong>5.</strong>&nbsp;Set short goals within tiers, to step members through to the next threshold.</p>
<p>All of this adds up to one key takeaway: share the journey. If we want consumers to get to that gold or platinum level, we should be guiding them. Otherwise, everyone is lost.</p>

Given this level of marketing turmoil, is there still a role for the traditional published loyalty program?</p>
<div>Grocery is an industry deep in debate on this very question, with key competitors coming to dramatically different answers. Some grocers have folded their loyalty programs completely, but is that the right solution? While I understand the reasoning behind this decision, it strikes me as a short-term solution that overlooks a well-designed program&rsquo;s ability to drive long-term profits.</div>
<p><img src=""/dotAsset/f42c1216-8c8f-482b-a506-b1018e9e30a4.jpg"" width=""250"" height=""167"" alt=""Maximizing the value of a retail loyalty program"" title=""Maximizing the value of a retail loyalty program"" style=""float: right; margin: 5px; border: 2px solid black;"" /></p>
<p>Grocers tend to be tightly focused on near-term profitability, but dropping a loyalty program is actually a lost opportunity. A published loyalty program can help grocers &ldquo;de-commoditize&rdquo; grocery shopping, which is why the industry should be examining ways to update loyalty strategy instead of ceding this ground, especially to competition from mass retailers.</p>
<p>I see four ways that grocers can improve their published programs:</p>
<p>&bull; Develop a differentiated loyalty experience. Operational complexities have blocked many in-store experience enhancements (mention dedicated lanes to a grocery operations head and see if you don&rsquo;t get an eye-roll). But compelling enhancements can be made for loyalty members, including in-lane redemption of rewards, the ability to pool/pay forward rewards, and testing scan/go or quick pick-up options for best customers.</p>
<p>&bull; Incentivize targeted purchases and emphasize bonusing. Grocery programs today incent most purchases with a base reward rate. Consider instead a rewards structure built around store and vendor funding bonusing and support for key categories. Customer engagement is maintained and the financial liability is much more contained. Walgreen&rsquo;s Balanced Rewards is doing this right, with points awarded for purchasing promotional items of the week, and consistent support for their bedrock pharmacy business.</p>
<p>&bull; Expand upon fuel as an incentive. Fuel is a compelling reward category, but it does little to reinforce why customers choose a grocer over a mass merchant when purchasing their food. Generally, one-third of a grocer&rsquo;s customers will not engage in a fuel-based program. Incentives need to reinforce the brand, aligned with a differentiating product or customer experience.</p>
<p>&bull; Squeeze profitability from customer data. Data insights can inform merchandising decisions, promotions, sales messaging and more to build sustainable engagement. This pays dividends across all sectors of the business to shape a value proposition that customers see as a real differentiator. Kroger, Supervalu, and other retail leaders are overcoming traditional competitive challenges, by using data across the organization to reach and engage customers.</p>

Hotel operators can improve business performance through improved utilization of customer insight at all levels of hotel operations. Specifically, hotel operators need to empower every employee to use insights based on customer behavior and preference data to enhance guest experiences. The results will be dramatic.</p>
<p>Hospitality giants like Caesars Entertainment and Hilton Worldwide have implemented far-reaching programs that leverage customer data to improve engagement and enhance customer loyalty. Successful approaches by companies in other industries are also instructional and can be applied to hotel operations.</p>
<p>The key to success is organizational alignment &ndash; putting the right customer strategy in place, aligning objectives, and training and empowering employees.</p>
<p><strong>Collecting Customer Data</strong></p>
<p>So how can hotel operators tap into the Big Data phenomenon for customer insights? Start by reviewing the two primary types of information available: attitudinal data and behavioral data.</p>
<p>Attitudinal / Lifestyle data can be collected via solicited methods, such as guest experience surveys, preference center data or other unsolicited methods. Key insights can be generated from these sources using unstructured data analytics. Both solicited and unsolicited data can provide quality insights, and many hotel operators already have processes in place for monitoring and reporting such results using either customer experience management firms or internal tools to produce performance dashboards, field management communications and other best practice or innovation sharing solutions.</p>
<p>Lifestyle data can be appended via many data sources, however an oftentimes under-utilized resource is employees themselves. Customer Relationship Management (CRM) software or clienteling solutions make capturing and sharing guest information easier than ever before. Employees can enter guest data into a software solution and contribute details about a particular guest&rsquo;s visit preferences (like favorite meals or room location) as well as personal information such as birthday, names of children, favorite wine or local restaurants they prefer. Once the data has been entered, the challenge becomes consistent utilization of the knowledge. The key is to provide a mechanism and the proper incentives for employees to enter the information into a central source and make it accessible to the appropriate personnel.</p>
<p>The downside: attitudinal and lifestyle data alone can be misleading without knowing who is responding. Is the survey response from a leisure traveller who stays a few nights a year? Or is it a business executive who books a week every month? In any case, the value of each response should be weighted toward higher value, higher potential value guests.</p>
<p>Behavioral data includes reservation and stay data, on-property transaction data, customer engagement data including web and mobile usage patterns and profile completion to name a few.</p>
<p>Where customer engagement efforts can fall short is when companies make experiential changes based on attitudinal/satisfaction feedback without understanding and monitoring the behavioral shifts of the guests. This advanced analytical approach can provide an understanding of the strategic and financial impact that changes in the guest experience have on sales and profits.</p>
<p>Caesars Entertainment, one of the world's largest diversified casino entertainment companies, provides a compelling example of fostering a customer service culture thru the linkage of attitudinal and behavioral data. In 2012, Caesars&rsquo; expansion of its Total Rewards program resulted in a 20% increase in new members thanks to a sophisticated program led by customer data analysis that integrated employee engagement and rewards systems. The rewards program expansion &ndash;including a relaunch of its online presence, which now references historical data to anticipate guest needs and present real-time offers &ndash; has increased customer value by up to 30% per visit.</p>
<p>The development of customer insight &ndash; both from an attitudinal and behavioral perspective &ndash; is an invaluable component of any effort at improving customer loyalty.</p>
<p><strong>Are You Clienteling?</strong></p>
<p>CRM systems can feed into a larger practice called &ldquo;clienteling.&rdquo; The term has been popular in the retail industry for several years and the approach is now crossing over en masse to hospitality.</p>
<p>The hallmarks of clienteling include the integration of enterprise technology and seamless access to actionable data by associates. Clienteling embraces the importance of the immediate, one-to-one connection that employees make with each guest throughout the entire experience. Linking the entire guest experience to enabling technology and a robust customer strategy can increase your brand&rsquo;s ability to personalize the primary interaction points, enhancing guest engagement and in turn, sales and profits. Those positive interactions strengthen relationships with key customers in specific ways that generate more frequent purchases.</p>
<p>The customer relationship is fostered by consistent service across the enterprise &ndash; from a guest&rsquo;s initial search for room availability to the reservation process to check-in to the in-house restaurant. Online and mobile channels provide the tools to expand the personalized messaging that continues reinforcing the brand&rsquo;s connection with the customer: reminders and confirmations can validate the customer&rsquo;s choice and provide a sense of privilege and control. These digital channels are also effective in maintaining the relationship post-stay.</p>
<p>Linking employees in different departments with key guest information is like passing the baton in a relay race &ndash; each part of the customer experience is connected and each employee plays a role.</p>
<p>As an example, Hilton Worldwide, through the principles of enterprise loyalty, uses its data to inform decisions across the entire organization, from online booking to location venues to restaurant menus. Hilton Worldwide&rsquo;s proprietary CRM platform provides a common view of its guests across all touch points, giving employees real-time access to individual preferences so they can provide a personalized experience during the entire stay.</p>
<p><strong>Empowering Employees</strong></p>
<p>Once an employee gets the customer &ldquo;baton,&rdquo; will he or she have the information &ndash; and motivation &ndash; to deliver on the service promise?</p>
<p>Empowerment is a major issue for successful implementation. However, &ldquo;blind empowerment&rdquo; may lead to the wrong behaviors and a reduction in economic gains. Preparing employees with the training and knowledge to provide great customer service puts the responsibility on them. USAA Financial Services, nationally recognized for its high quality customer service, sends its call center employees to six months of training before they answer a call. This gives them a deep understanding of the issues that military personnel typically have to face &ndash; making them more adept at assisting them as customers.</p>
<p>Many retail companies have a &lsquo;make it right&rsquo; policy that allows employees to give refunds or credit to disgruntled or disappointed customers. USAA Financial Services and eBay both have received national recognition for programs that allow employees to immediately address customer problems. In the case of Caesars, if a guest has an unlucky streak at a particular game, the proprietary CRM system deploys a host to alleviate the situation, perhaps by buying the guest dinner.</p>
<p>In many cases, hotels create a discretionary budget and encourage employees to quickly address situations with customers before the experience is damaged. Employees may be given specific goals for customer engagement for each shift &ndash; for example, a ma&icirc;tre d&rsquo; may have five bottles of wine that he must give to first-time diners in the on-site restaurant.</p>
<p>Internet footwear and clothing giant Zappos maintains a fanatical customer following by allowing its employees to act swiftly, take responsibility (often when the fault is beyond their control), enable staff discretion to fix problems, compensate fairly, do a little something extra to acknowledge inconveniences and follow-up until the issue is brought to satisfactory closure.</p>
<p><strong>Leadership and Participation</strong></p>
<p>Who should lead customer engagement initiatives? It has to start at the top. Property managers and owners must take the lead to introduce &ndash; then provide ongoing support for &ndash; the program.</p>
<p>As a corporate-owned or franchisee, many hotel operators will likely receive tools that will help enable the desired brand experience, but implementation has to take place at the individual property level. Each market is different, the competition can vary, and personnel and team make-up must be considered. Therefore, managers need to take the available tools and customize them to their needs and particular situation.</p>
<p>Since the program begins &lsquo;top down,&rsquo; it&rsquo;s important to create a feedback loop for getting insights from the grassroots level. The process has to be a two-way street: a strategic plan from management that&rsquo;s open to suggestions and flexible enough to accommodate input from the people with direct contact with guests.</p>
<p>One method for employee engagement may be gamification. This approach can add an element of fun and competition for participants. Specific goals should be established to change or establish behaviors, with individual and/or group rewards along the way. Many templated programs or apps are available for creating and tracking programs like this; a customized online program or app can be created, but may incur additional costs.</p>
<p><strong>Overcoming Obstacles</strong></p>
<p>Within the hospitality industry, obstacles remain to empowering customer-facing employees with data-based insights. The major challenges include:</p>
<p><strong>1. Investing for the long term</strong>&nbsp;- Developing a customer relationship isn&rsquo;t like flipping a switch, though initial efforts can show immediate results. Small steps can lead to long term success with consistent delivery of the brand promise. Time will be required as expectations, in some cases, are re-set.</p>
<p><strong>2. Training and education of staff</strong>&nbsp;- New habits need to be established and employees will need the appropriate time and resources to successfully adjust. Research shows that adult learners absorb more through doing than reading. High performing staff members can be rewarded with tools to pilot new elements of the guest experience &ndash; and recognizing their contributions by allowing them to mentor other staff members as the guest experience is transformed over time.</p>
<p><strong>3. Fear of change</strong>&nbsp;- It&rsquo;s human nature to want to preserve the status quo and avoid a less certain future. Timely and effective communication, along with an opportunity to provide feedback, can answer most concerns. Be clear with tangible goals and unambiguous expectations.</p>
<p><strong>4. Lack of commitment and follow up</strong>&nbsp;- Dr. John P. Kotter, professor emeritus at Harvard Business School and a leading authority on organizational change management, suggests that leadership should estimate how much communication of an organizational vision is needed, and then multiply that effort by a factor of ten. So, realize ahead of time that this is not an initiative that can &ldquo;checked off&rdquo; and returned to next year &ndash; it needs on-going attention and support.</p>
<p><strong>Team Spirit vs. Individual Achievement</strong></p>
<p>An additional challenge is not organizational, but individual. As part of the CRM or clienteling process, an employee is asked to share customer information &ndash; information on a relationship that he has carefully grown and nurtured. Especially if an employee works on a commission or incentive basis, surrendering those customer insights may be difficult.</p>
<p>This may require an adjustment on management&rsquo;s part. Those customer insights can have tremendous value across the enterprise, so obtaining them may be worth making changes in compensation. Reducing the emphasis on commissions or basing incentives on group goals or achievements can help defuse these situations.</p>
<p><strong>Actionable Insights that Drive Customer Loyalty</strong></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s true that Big Data will have a tremendous impact on the hospitality industry. And we have access to more raw data that ever before. But mountains of data will mean little if strategic insights are not put into action.</p>
<p>Practical, personalized applications of customer knowledge improve the guest experience and builds long-term loyalty. The growth in customer loyalty means return business &ndash; which repeats the cycle and reinforces the relationship.</p>
<p>As evidenced by the successful companies listed in this article, the investment and dedication to applying customer insights pays off in the long-term &ndash; to both the top and bottom lines.</p>

<p><strong>What professional advice would you give someone who is at the start of their career path?</strong><br />Take the opportunity to learn what others do, to help determine what you do/don&rsquo;t like, ask lots of questions, and be prepared to take advice.</p>
<p><strong>Do you have a mentor? Do you have a mentee? Share your experience with mentorship and building a network of people to turn to. Where did you start?</strong><br />Yes to both! Never underestimate the power of someone else giving you their perspective; it will help you to refine your own thinking and appreciate the diversity of experience. There are benefits to both formal and informal mentoring; I started with the informal.</p>
<p><strong>What is one characteristic that you believe every leader should possess?</strong><br />A great sense of humour. Work is challenging enough; humour helps us cope, lets us relax and connect with others in a different way.</p>
<p><strong>If you had one piece of thought provoking advice for women in business, what would that be?</strong></p>
<p>Anytime we catch ourselves saying the word &lsquo;should&rsquo;, recognize this is a guilt trip that we need to abandon. Focus on needs and wants; those are more authentic.</p>
<p><strong>If we were to listen to you iPod, what would we find?</strong><br />A whole range of music, from pop to classical to R&amp;B and folk; I like variety to suit my mood and circumstance.</p>
<p><strong>How do you encourage creative thinking within your team? Are there any extracurricular activities that help you tap into your creativity?</strong><br />I&rsquo;ve found that small actions make a difference. My coach helped me see the value in getting out of the office to think/talk while walking. Having meetings in a different part of the building, asking for views from those outside the normal network and allowing ourselves to ask &lsquo;what if&rsquo; questions all help to break up standard patterns.</p>
<p><strong>When faced with two equally-qualified candidates, how do you determine whom to hire?</strong><br />It&rsquo;s not just about &lsquo;skill&rsquo;, it&rsquo;s also about &lsquo;will&rsquo; &ndash; does that person want to learn the business and how to work effectively with their colleagues, are they prepared to both adapt and help others adapt to them in ways that will add value.</p>
<p><strong>What is the one behavior or trait that you have seen derail more leaders&rsquo; careers?</strong><br />Arrogance, as it leads to poor behaviours fueled by insecurity.</p>

HERE'S HOW TO CLIMB THE APP MARKETING MOUNTAIN.","<p>Marketers may compare launching a successful mobile app to summiting Mount Everest. In actuality, you have better odds with the mountain.</p>
<p>The average smartphone user downloaded 26 apps in 2013, yet recent research shows he or she continued using only about six of them. The remaining 20 were left to collect virtual dust or were deleted, according to recent research by LoyaltyOne.</p>
<p>With a 22% chance of maintaining engagement--compared with a 29% success rate of summiting Mount Everest--what can marketers do to ensure their apps maintain peak interest?</p>
<p>Consumers want both convenience and utility from their apps. This should be a no brainer, but the research detailed in the Mobile App Transaction Study also spells out less obvious ways for marketers to consult on apps that improve the brand experience and increase loyalty.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll detail these ways soon, but in the meantime here&rsquo;s a hint: among the apps most frequently identified in the study are those that pretty much bring the mountain to the consumer--Starbucks, Amazon, eBay, and Nike.</p>
<p><strong>LEADING THE CHARGE: THE YOUNG AND THE RICH</strong><br />Step one, let&rsquo;s look at the market. The LoyaltyOne research shows that while the average smartphone user has downloaded 26 apps, tablet users are more active, downloading an average of 29. So how does that shake out?</p>
<p>Overall, smartphones are still in the lead, even if they do carry fewer apps. About 57% of the U.S. general population uses a smartphone, and 27% uses a tablet, according to a 2013 report from Pew Research Center&rsquo;s Internet &amp; American Life Project. Two key groups lead in that adoption: adults aged 18 to 25, of whom 68% use smartphones and 37% use tablets; and the affluent, with 65% using smartphones and 47% using tablets.</p>
<p>Globally, mobile subscriptions have risen 7% in 2013 from 2012, with an estimated 4.5 billion unique mobile subscribers tapping into one or more devices, according to the Ericsson Mobility Report, which measures data traffic. (The figure takes into consideration that one person may have more than one mobile device subscription.)</p>
<p>Combine all of these figures and it&rsquo;s easy to understand why pretty much every major brand is seeking some sort of app presence, from one that features a sizzling piece of meat (Longhorn) to one that alerts the user when the baby has wet his diaper (Huggies).</p>
<p>Less understood among marketers, evidently, is what these billions of users want in their little screen devices.</p>
<p><strong>AIM TO EITHER ENTERTAIN OR BE USEFUL</strong><br />Two key traits prevail when it comes to app success, according to the survey. The app needs to be entertaining and deliver games, music, and other fun diversions; or it should be utility-based and offer services such as news, education, weather, and maps.</p>
<p>Drill down deeper, and survey respondents ranked finances and convenience as the top elements that engage them with an app. Forty-two percent said they prefer apps that help them gain access to discounts and lower prices, and an equal percentage want apps that help them simplify or organize their lives.</p>
<p><strong>What consumers do not want:</strong> They expressly do not want self-serving ads. Do not test them on this. Social media is a very effective platform for consumers seeking to register a public complaint.</p>
<p><strong>DON'T GET LOST IN THE CROWD</strong><br />There's a lot of competition out there. Navigate your way to the top with these strategies:</p>
<p><em>1. Tweak the check-in</em><br />Lots of marketers encourage consumers to use app check-ins because they allow for tracking, but the check-in promotions often used for this don't actually increase transactions over the long term. Instead, marketers should consider rewarding those who check-in and then perform a desired behavior--think of it as &ldquo;Check-In Plus.&rdquo; For example, an app could award bonus points or offers to members who check-in and make a purchase, or check-in and redeem a coupon. This kind of immediate reward will more likely keep the customer interested, and encourage repeat brand interactions.</p>
<p><em>2. Rethink time of day</em><br />Timing is particularly important to the mobile user. When the app operator understands what a customer is doing at any given time of the day, it can tailor its communications to individual preferences and send them at a time when the customer is most likely to be receptive. For example, most people use their mobile devices to check the weather and read news in the early morning, so that would be an opportune time for a coffee shop to deliver a coupon along with information about local traffic or weather. Consumers tend to use smartphones or tablets during the workday to do online banking or shopping. Entertainment, such as gaming and watching movies, is often saved until evening or right before bedtime.</p>
<p><em>3. Make the most of the overlap</em><br />The best apps inform more than sell, and provide reliably helpful tools rather than just promotional information. The study reveals a sweet spot of app overlap, where customers identify two desired features they want to see in both general and branded apps: convenience and utility. A great example is a shopping list app that makes suggestions about what and when to purchase based on history and coupons available. If an app solves these lifestyle needs and also throws in a bit of entertainment, it&rsquo;s less likely to end up in the app graveyard.</p>
<p><em>4. Create emotional engagement</em><br />People who download and check in to an app are likely to already be engaged with the brand. This highlights an app&rsquo;s potential for identifying and engaging the brand&rsquo;s best customers. Marketers can use the app to get a company&rsquo;s most engaged customers to raise their hands, and then build the app around their preferences and behaviors, enabling the organization to address key opportunities.</p>
<p>These tips will help marketers devise apps that stand apart from others, but the battle to maintain interest is still an uphill one. Consider that in the time it took to read this article, more than 250,000 apps have been downloaded globally. That, in and of itself, is a mountain worth climbing.</p>",,,,,,SYSTEM_HOST,,1

<p>Think for a moment &ndash; where are you most effective in completing your work? When you have a hard deadline or project that requires focus, where do you physically position yourself to accomplish this task? Most of us have a favourite spot for this &ndash; a home office, in the office but before or after hours, a cozy chair at Starbucks. However the response to this question is rarely, &ldquo;in my workstation during office hours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There are many reasons for this: interruptions from well-meaning co-workers, lack of visual or auditory privacy, or being pulled into impromptu meetings. All of this falls under normal work environment activity but it can have a negative effect on your ability to focus.</p>
<p>So, how can we make the work environment the first place that staff will choose for work that encourages peak effectiveness and productivity?</p>
<p>At LoyaltyOne, we are embarking on implementing a Flexible Work project. The goal of this project is to optimize the density of our space to save real estate costs while providing a more effective work environment for staff &ndash; with more choices of where and how to work. This project will implement an unassigned seating model, bring our executives out of their offices into the midst of our teams, collocate project team members together in an &ldquo;agile&rdquo; work environment, allow people to have the flexibility to work from home and implement optimal collaboration spaces.</p>
<p>Certainly sounds like a lot of new furniture is in store. But new designs and surroundings alone will not accomplish our goals &ndash; this is really a change management project. We need to train our current staff to change how they work, embrace new business technologies, to stay connected and use these enhancements to win the war for new talent.</p>
<p>With so many Generation Y workers in the talent pool &mdash; nearly one third of Canada&rsquo;s population is born between 1980 and 2000. Video chat, smart phones and new types of collaborative, flexible workplaces that embrace this technology will appeal to this very tech savvy, social crowd of employees. After all, with the rise of technology that we have seen over the past decade, the main benefits of working in the office are largely social in nature and outweigh productivity, access to tools, equipment or files.</p>
<p>So, as we enter 2014, with the changing talent landscape and the advent of flexible tech equipped workplaces, what are you doing to improve the effectiveness of your office environment this year? Perhaps it is time for your organization to re-consider your work environment, how your employees and teams work together and interact, and what technologies your organization can harness to create an encouraging workspace.</p>",,,,,,SYSTEM_HOST,,1

<p>Darlene&nbsp;Frampton&nbsp;is senior vice president of brand strategy for YMCA Canada. She says 20 per cent of new YMCA members stop coming after the first three to six months.&nbsp;</p>

<p>That motivation comes courtesy of a unique, multi-sector partnership between&nbsp;YMCA Canada, the Public Health Agency of Canada and <a href=""/coalition-loyalty/air-miles/incentives-for-social-change.html"">AIR MILES for Social Change</a>&nbsp;&mdash; a social venture that&rsquo;s part of the Air Miles Program.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the&nbsp;pilot program that included 15 YMCA locations across the country, 46,000 members received 25 miles for signing up&nbsp;and then could earn one mile for every two visits to the gym.&nbsp;</p>
<p>""Sixty-three per cent of active YMCA members who engaged in this incentives programs did visit one to six times more per week over the same time as last year,""&nbsp;Frampton&nbsp;said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Of those increased visits,&nbsp;18 per cent were children&nbsp;accompanying&nbsp;their parents, a statistic&nbsp;Frampton&nbsp;finds encouraging as her organization works to keep kids active. But she also said having more active and engaged members offers&nbsp;a larger pool of people who are more likely to become volunteers and donors to the YMCA's charitable causes.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href=""/about-us/our-leadership/business-leads.html?p=angela-simo-brown"">Angela&nbsp;Simo&nbsp;Brown</a> is general manager and&nbsp;co-founder&nbsp;of AIR MILES for Social Change.

<p>&ldquo;Canadians want to make healthier choices, they just need the right incentive,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>When data showed&nbsp;most YMCA members were averaging one to two visits a week, they tested different&nbsp;incentive packages to see which ones would best motivate members to make one more visit as a habit.&nbsp;</p>
<p>""Hopefully they sustain that behaviour,&rdquo;&nbsp;Simo&nbsp;Brown said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Simo&nbsp;Brown said&nbsp;the miles are provided to YMCA members through a matching program between Air Miles for Social Change and the Public Health Agency of Canada, redirecting money the agency would have spent on advertising.</p>
<p>The pilot program wraps up in April, but all parties are keen to see it continue.

Here are seven that address key issues in 2014.","<p>For loyalty marketers in the retail industry, a new year offers the chance to assess the marketplace and commit to business-related resolutions. Here are seven that address key issues in 2014.</p>
<p><b>1. Tune in to the Omnichannel Approach</b></p>
<p>A step beyond multi-channel, omnichannel covers all customer touch points with a comprehensive, integrated, uniform strategy.</p>
<p>Customers see little difference between making a purchase at a retail location, from home via the web or by mobile app while sitting in a coffee shop. An effective omnichannel strategy offers seamless transitions between those options while maintaining the customer&rsquo;s individual experience preferences.</p>
<p>Ultimately, well-planned omnichannel programs create opportunities and facilitate regular, meaningful interactions to keep customers engaged with the brand.</p>
<p><b>2. Get Segment Specific</b></p>
<p>Current technology provides member segmentation specificity that was unattainable just five years ago.</p>
<p>Loyalty marketers should take the time to thoroughly review databases for behavioral indicators that may offer new opportunities. After determining the right motivators, they can develop an offer to capitalize on that behavior.</p>
<p>Most importantly, a system for measurement should be set up&nbsp;<i>before</i>&nbsp;beginning implementation. Testing concepts and programs with smaller groups can generate insights that can be applied to broader audiences.</p>
<p><b>3. Different Tiers, Different Strategies</b></p>
<p>Classify members based on their actual or potential value and assign them to tiers with separate marketing strategies.</p>
<p>The top tier should receive special status with an emphasis on soft benefits and exclusive rewards. High-value members just below the top tier exhibit the potential to join the premier group and should be cultivated accordingly.</p>
<p>The next tier typically represents the bulk of the member database; the right mix of hard and soft benefits can move the needle with this group. Tiering strategies work because program resources can be allocated according to value in a more overt, motivational fashion.</p>
<p><b>4. Use Mobile Apps APPropriately</b></p>
<p>LoyaltyOne&rsquo;s 2013 Social Word-of-Mouth study reports the average smartphone owner downloads 26 apps but uses only six of them daily. Clearly, the real estate on a consumer&rsquo;s main screen is hot property.</p>
<p>The savvy marketer, recognizing an app&rsquo;s potential, gets highly engaged customers to raise their hands then builds the app around customer preferences and behaviors. The APPropriate use of apps increases transaction volume and total earnings, and maintains those higher numbers over the long term.</p>
<p><b>5. Honor the Information Exchange: Restore the Faith</b></p>
<p>LoyaltyOne research shows that consumers in 2013 reported significantly lower expectations around the benefits of sharing personal data.</p>
<p>Restore consumers&rsquo; faith in loyalty programs by using data to improve customer service, make the buying process easier, send communications based on customer preferences, tailor offers to customer purchases, give preferential treatment and provide access to exclusive offers and events.</p>
<p>Honoring the information exchange means identifying each customer&rsquo;s top purchasing priorities and delivering relevant offers at precisely the right moment.</p>
<p><b>6. Don&rsquo;t Be Afraid to Be Dynamic</b></p>
<p>Retailers can combine loyalty membership data with current technology to send individualized prices in the form of electronic coupons via email, or via the retailer&rsquo;s web site. The coupons can be added to the customer&rsquo;s loyalty card for redemption at the register.</p>
<p>Retailers can also send electronic coupons via text message or apps to a customer&rsquo;s mobile phone &mdash; enabling redemption by scanning barcodes or QR codes at the register.</p>
<p>Shoppers will react favorably to highly relevant personalized prices delivered in a dynamic way that satisfy their specific needs.</p>
<p><b>7. This Above All&hellip;</b></p>
<p>Be true in 2014 to the real meaning of loyalty by committing to the development of long-term customer engagement strategies that foster sustainable, profitable growth.</p>
<p>American entrepreneur and orator Cavett Robert once said, &ldquo;Character is the ability to carry out a good resolution long after the excitement of the moment has passed.&rdquo; Here&rsquo;s hoping you can keep these loyalty marketing resolutions and enjoy a successful year in 2014.</p>",,,,,,SYSTEM_HOST,,1

Successful mass marketing - through mediums, such as TV, billboards and in-store advertising - builds both an extensive reach and a&nbsp;brand&nbsp;image that is positive enough to increase purchase consideration. But once a customer has had a bite of your brand, marketers who specialise in targeted marketing are best suited to execute the next leg of the journey. Targeted marketers work with smaller audiences and aim to convert one-time customers to repeat purchase customers. They use data to identify the best customers in the database, and find more customers that look like your best customers. Even more importantly, they can identify those with the potential to grow their purchasing of your brand. As the chart shows, the purpose of targeted marketing is to lift and shift customer spending to lead customers to regular consumption, or retention. At the retention stage, a company can attribute a regular spending behaviour to certain customers and also classify them as profitable.<br /><br />The marketing journey passes through three clear stages: mass marketing, targeted marketing and customer experience management (where customers who are sold on your brand are given more open appreciation and become real brand advocates). This journey is much like a funnel - you advertise the brand to a large base of prospective customers expecting a small number of them to proceed to product trial. An even smaller number will become frequent repeat customers, and only a handful will become brand advocates through social media and customer referrals.<br /><br /><b>Know thy customer</b><br />In India, the common practice is to collect customer birthdays as data points on which to build relationship. But personalised marketing activities mandate different sets of customer data and tools than what mass marketers use. For starters, targeted marketers can identify customers with accurate contact information and transactional data. This marks a turning point. Using this information and subsequently getting to know more about those customers drives a level of targeting and retail merchandising that goes deeper than what mass marketing can achieve.<br /><br /><b>Models for success</b><br />Modelling helps targeted marketers make sense of customer-specific data collated for a huge number of customers. It would be prohibitively expensive to make relevant offers to individual customers based on their personal situations. So, targeted marketers create financial models based on segments populated by such customer data. This allows them to create segments of customers who have similar shopper profiles, and are equally likely to respond. Then, marketers can target offers to specific segments instead of the entire customer database. Segmentation models yield lists of high-value customers. Propensity models help marketers determines, which customers might be interested in a new product line.<br /><br />Individual customer spend curves inform marketers of precisely when that customer is likely to have higher purchasing power and, hence, is best targeted. Trigger-based campaigns and geo-targeting are other useful models.<br /><br /></p>
<div><img align=""left"" alt="""" height=""240"" src=""http://bsmedia.business-standard.com/_media/bs/img/article/2013-12/01/full/1385912579-2306.jpg"" title="""" width=""366"" /></div>
<p><b>India-specific challenges</b><br />Targeted marketing can help Indian brands get ahead in the competitive environments they operate in, provided they surmount the following challenges:<br /><br />Balancing product marketing with targeted marketing: India's best marketers are trained in fast moving consumer goods (FMCG), and are very effective product marketers, focusing on brand building, product awareness and market share growth. When balanced with targeted marketing, product marketers get the support they need to pull the customer from awareness to retention and ultimately, advocacy.<br /><br />Limited locational data: Indian brands currently have limited access to data that informs them about their customers' locations. However, with the explosion in the use of mobile devices, we can expect this to change in the near future. This will open up the option of using locational data to target a customer as she walks into a store or even into just the vicinity of a store. The only snag might be data privacy concerns, which are the biggest threat to location marketing in the West.<br /><br />Limited customer behavioural data: Many companies in India boast of huge customer databases, but more than 50 percent of names in those databases are either inactive or not accurate. Furthermore, the data that is accurate is not particularly predictive from the perspective of targeted marketing because it lacks detailed information on behaviour. Brands must create strategies to pick up genuinely useful data on what individual customers are buying, when and where they are buying and what they are redeeming over time.<br /><br /><b>A new perception</b><br />A change in marketers' perception about loyalty programmes can help the cause of targeted marketing in India. At its core, a loyalty programme is a means to capture data, not just to increase brand impressions. Each loyalty member receives a transactional device - a physical or a virtual card that identifies consumer and helps track her order transactions. The good news also is that the Indian market is no where near saturated with loyalty initiatives like in other countries. For example, 74 per cent of consumers in the United States belong to at least one programme and 90 percent of consumers in Canada participate in loyalty programmes (source: the 2011 COLLOQUY Cross-Cultural Study), whereas participation in India is merely 42 percent.<br /><br />A data-driven loyalty programme is the engine that can carry marketers along their customer acquisition and retention journeys.<br /><br /><b>Prepare to give, to get</b><br />But, how does one do this? Reward attainability is the number one thing that changes consumer behaviour. Essentially, loyalty programmes do just that, by dangling a carrot (reward, incentive) within each customer's reach in return for data. For instance, some customers want to exchange their points or vouchers for something that is tangible and functional, and to do so now. They want to monetise their relationships with your brands without delay. Another category of customers is aspirational. They are happy to hang on to their collected points until they can redeem them for merchandise, or something like a special, higher-end item or a trip. A third category of redeemers are typically your very best customers. They collect points or vouchers for years and redeem them only for curated experiences like family vacations.<br /><br />All marketers must put a stronger focus on customer experience, in-store and through their communications. The 2009 COLLOQUY Loyalty Demographics study explored the value that different customer segments place on experience and recognition benefits like perks and privileges. It measured the gap between customer expectations and actual experiences in the programmes they participate in. The average gap between these two metrics was nearly 40 per cent. Knowing who your best customers are can help bridge this disparity. For instance, at Tanishq, Tata's jewellery brand, the best customers get opportunities to interact with senior management members and invitations to workshops regarding the nuances of jewellery making. These experiences are thoughtful and relevant to Tanishq customers. Thus, using customer analysis to define relevant experiences is not just a nice customer benefit, it is proven to increase activation rates, spend and loyalty.</p>",,,,,,SYSTEM_HOST,,0

<p>Brands are hard to ignore; they are so compelling in their appeal that others follow suit. If it wasn&rsquo;t so,brands such as Heinz, Coca-Cola, McDonald&rsquo;s, Mercedes and Louis Vuitton would not have become the immortal brands they are today.</p>
<p>To build an enduring brand, you need loyal followers. We all know that. Brands know it too. So what do some brands do that others don&rsquo;t that make them stay at the top of the game for decades together? Somehow they seem to have it all figured out. They have flawlessly implemented the idea of staying relevant and consistent while continuing to amplify the competitive landscape.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The big deal about making ideas happen</strong></p>
<p>As marketers we are always conceptualizing, creating and managing brands to be able to build long lasting and enriching customer relationships that truly stick. Through our brand innovation and activation campaigns we are striving to create an everlasting connection with our customers that will help establish brand loyalty, customer value and engagement.</p>
<p>So if we want to enhance our brand loyalty, we know sustainability is crucial. We need to deliver compelling value to each customer, every time. We also need to create and deliver reasons for our customers to come back to us time and again. Over a period of time, our customers become our brand evangelists and that is the ultimate win for any brand.</p>
<p>The same truth works for loyalty brands. To engage with our customers and to deliver consistent brand experiences, a loyalty brand has to have a clear program design and strategy in place along with clearly defined objectives.</p>
<p><strong>The truth about loyalty brands, and more</strong></p>
<p>Building consumer or loyalty brands involves similar and arduous journeys. This is the reason why consumer brands and loyalty brands need to be differentiated in strategy, approach and long-term treatment. For a consumer brand, it is most essential to create mass awareness and build a positive attitude towards the brand. All initial consumer brand marketing initiatives are targeted at that because it creates the desire for trial. And trial is fundamental to introducing a new brand or making a consumer try an existing brand.</p>
<p>(However)&nbsp; just creating awareness of the consumer brand which leads to trial is just half of the job done. This is where the loyalty brand is supposed to take over by creating consumer relevant offers and activations that will drive lift and shift in consumer spends resulting in customer retention and (eventually) brand loyalty. The loyalty brand relentlessly works on building the customer&rsquo;s interest in the brand and moving it notches up. If done well, a satisfied customer&nbsp; will start endorsing and referring the brand to others resulting in positive word of mouth and brand advocacy.</p>
<p><strong>The magic of one message in one brand</strong></p>
<p>Loyalty brands play a crucial role in enhancing customer relationships and building brand advocacy. Hence, marketers are now putting increased efforts to create differentiated loyalty brands by clearing defining its program design and strategy, objectives and what the loyalty brand should stand for. Now marketers are willing to create loyalty brands that have a single message but with multiple manifestations.</p>
<p>We are already noticing a trend where large organizations have started consolidating their multiple loyalty programs into one single umbrella loyalty program which represents their overall organizational philosophy being brought alive through a single loyalty program.&nbsp; The Encircle loyalty program of Titan Industries is one good example here where the program weaves together three separate loyalty programs into one single consolidated loyalty program.</p>
<p>For instance, a customer walks into a World of Titan store to buy a watch for his wife. While making the purchase when the assistant punches in the relevant Encircle customer code the system shows the customer&rsquo;s accumulated points and also flashes a useful piece of information: the birthday of the customer&rsquo;s son is just around the corner. It prompts the assistant to ask: &ldquo;Would you like to see the new range of Fastrack sunglasses, perhaps as a birthday gift for your son. You have enough points to buy one for free.&rdquo; Based on shared values, such customer value proposition is most likely a winner all the way. Even in the long term, it is invaluable for improving customer understanding and ensuring product relevancy.</p>
<p><strong>Know how to do it the best possible way</strong></p>
<p><strong>Begin with a program health check-up.</strong>&nbsp;A basic scan to know what is working, what is not and more importantly, what will work better. A program health check-up will help you arrive at your loyalty dashboard&mdash;a quick snapshot of program outcomes with key customer behavior indicators of enrollment and key financial performance indicators of sales lift, retention impact, acquisition impact, and the total expense of the program. This is a great and comprehensive way to measure your program outcomes and to track the performance of your loyalty brand.</p>
<p><strong>Now you need to figure outyour consumer value proposition</strong>. The proposition is mainly determined by the loyalty program and its design that gets crafted while creating the loyalty strategy around the brand. The end benefit for the user needs to appeal to the target consumers so that they know and agree with the answer for the crucial &ldquo;What&rsquo;s in it for me?&rdquo; question.</p>
<p><strong>Keep the message simple.</strong>As marketeers when we are devising the loyalty strategy or crafting the loyalty message, it is important to think and imagine from the consumers&rsquo; point of view. We have a tough task in breaking through the clutter and effectivelyreaching out to our customers. The trick is, therefore, in keeping it simple and consistent and in delivering the promise.</p>
<p><strong>Identify your high-value customers.</strong>&nbsp;It is very important to identify the profile of customers who have the maximum potential to deliver on your business objectives of growth and profitability. Create a visual mind map of who these customers really are to be able to make relevant and meaningful offers to them.</p>
<p><strong>Treat each customer as unique.&nbsp;</strong>In India, there is great risk in treating consumers as one homogenous group. With 28 states and many different languages, cultures and ethnicities, the world&rsquo;s second most populous country (with over 1.2 billion people) behaves more like a collection of smaller countries. Therefore, it is important to segment consumers by their transaction behavior that you capture during their purchase cycles across festivals and special occasions.</p>
<p><strong>Use data effectively.&nbsp;</strong>Once you know, who your consumers are, how and when they spend and what they look for, create a comprehensive mix of rewards to meet their various needs. You can make your rewards unique and exclusive to suit each customer profile segments. Also, this data will help you make key decisions that will be central to the success of your loyalty program in the near future.</p>
<p><strong>Use multiple communication channels.&nbsp;</strong>Leverage multi-channel marketing services like direct, digital and mobile marketing to effectively reach and connect with your customers. This will help create a 360 communication environment to convey your key messages through various consumer engagement touch points.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, every customer is looking for a value proposition that works for him and is not too hard to understand. He or she does not have to struggle to answer the &ldquo;What&rsquo;s in it for me?&rdquo; question. Investing in and building your loyalty brand will further enhance your consumer brand for sustainable competitive advantage while adding more and more loyal customers all the way.</p>
<p>Every loyalty program has a unique and distinctive personality, understand yours and get it on the right track.</p>",,,,,,SYSTEM_HOST,,0

4331675c-6aa7-407d-b88d-1c7126f777fb,en,US,10/30/2013,The Secret To Apps That “Stick”,the-secret-to-apps-that-stick,ProfitGuide.com,http://www.profitguide.com/manage-grow/sales-marketing/the-secret-to-apps-that-stick-58970,The apps developed by most companies sit unused by the customer. Here's how to develop mobile tools that your clients will actually use.,"<p>It seems that today, there really is an app for just about everything, whether you're tracking calories and making meal plans or managing finances, booking vacations and hailing a taxi. But are businesses really cutting through the clutter and creating apps that are really useful to their customers?</p>
<p>LoyaltyOne's 2013 Mobile App Transaction Study shows that today's apps aren't as ""sticky"" as businesses and app developers may hope. According to the findings, while the average Canadian smartphone user has downloaded 25 apps, on average, only five of them are used daily. That means an app has a mere 18% chance of landing&mdash;and remaining&mdash;on a customer's main screen. Ouch.</p>
<p>But, there is hope yet. The consumers surveyed also indicated that what they want most from apps&mdash;especially branded apps&mdash;are entertainment (with 36% of respondents citing this), ways to stretch spending power (34%) and tools to make life easier (35%). Deliver an app that includes those benefits and you make it attractive for existing and potential customers to keep you at their fingertips.</p>
<p>For small businesses, a smartly designed mobile app that factors in relevant offers (rather than one that was created simply for the sake of joining the crowd) can mean increased loyalty and engagement from customers&mdash;which usually translates into long-term earnings. With that in mind, business owners who are thinking of creating a mobile app should keep in mind the following three tips to ensure they're creating smart, ""sticky"" apps customers will come to rely on:</p>
<p><strong>1. Create engaging check-ins</strong><br />Because check-in promotions don't increase transactions over the long term, businesses may get better results by rewarding check-in activity along with a desired behavior&mdash;think of it as ""Check-In Plus."" For example, an app could award bonus points to customers who check-in and make a purchase, share information through their social channels or redeem a coupon. A strong Check-In Plus strategy can help maintain long-term engagement while also establishing more habitual desired behaviors that drive closer engagement with the program.</p>
<p><strong>2. Timing is everything</strong><br />Businesses need to have a strong understanding of what their customers are doing at any given time of the day, and then tailor app messages and calls-to-action around customers' individual preferences. Encourage the call-to-action or share relevant information when customers are most likely to be receptive and on their mobile devices. For example, most people use their mobile devices to check the weather and read news in the early morning, so that would be an opportune time for a coffee shop to deliver a coupon or breakfast deal along with information about local traffic or weather.</p>
<p><strong>3. Don't forget the fun factor!</strong><br />The best apps inform more than sell, and provide helpful tools rather than just promotional information. Our study reveals a sweet spot of app overlap, where customers identify two desired features they want to see in both general and branded apps: convenience and utility. If your app solves a customer's lifestyle needs, and also throws in a bit of entertainment value, it's far more likely to end up on the main screen of someone's phone than in the app graveyard.</p>
<p>Entrepreneurs need to think of an app as part of the overall customer experience; it's not just a standalone channel in which to push content out, but rather a way in which to engage consumers in a dialogue.</p>
<p>Consumers may initially be attracted to the flashy new app. But smart businesses that offer apps with relevant information, promotions and tools that solve their customer's needs will pass the ultimate test of ""stickiness"", resulting in stronger engagement and long-term app and business loyalty.</p>",,,,,,SYSTEM_HOST,,1

The program has more than 10 million active members, called &ldquo;collectors,&rdquo; representing approximately two-thirds of all Canadian households. Emmie Fukuchi, associate vice president of digital &amp; new media for AIR MILES, spoke with eMarketer&rsquo;s Danielle Drolet about the mobile landscape in Canada and how the rewards program&rsquo;s business goals are aligned for success.</p>
<p><b>eMarketer:</b>&nbsp;What key trends are you seeing this year in mobile in Canada?</p>
<p><b>Emmie Fukuchi:</b>&nbsp;Smartphone penetration continues to climb in Canada. Now at more than 60%, we believe there are increasing opportunities to engage collectors on behalf of our sponsors.</p>
<p>With GPS capabilities being a standard feature of most smartphones, marketers have the opportunity to connect with consumers in a context-aware way&mdash;through push messages that provide consumers with opportunities to use mobile apps to engage with specific campaigns at the right time in their shopping journey.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;By capitalizing on the increased penetration of GPS-enabled devices, AIR MILES will be able to make specific offers to collectors when they reach a store or even enter a shopping mall.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>While more than 74% of smartphone owners get real-time location-based information, only 18% use a service to check in to locations. However, they are extremely open to receiving relevant coupons or offers when they reach a store location. By capitalizing on the increased penetration of GPS-enabled devices, AIR MILES will be able to make specific offers to collectors when they reach a store or even enter a shopping mall.</p>
<p><b>eMarketer:</b>&nbsp;One difference we are seeing from last year is that BlackBerry adoption has dropped off in Canada. What will the shift in adoption habits mean for your mobile efforts?</p>
<p><b>Fukuchi:</b>&nbsp;As previously noted, we are seeing great increases in smartphone penetration across Canada, but across our collector base, the iPhone still leads, with more than 40% of smartphone collectors using one. We have seen the most growth with Android-based devices, which have steadily risen and now make up 30% of all collector smartphones. We continue to monitor any uptick from the launch of the BlackBerry 10, but like the rest of the smartphone market, we have seen a decline in the number of our customers carrying BlackBerrys over the past year.</p>
<p>These market factors have caused our first priority on designs to be for iOS and Android devices. Should we see the demand and penetration rise for BlackBerry 10- or Windows-based devices, we would contemplate releasing new native apps for those operating systems, as well.</p>
<p><b>eMarketer:</b>&nbsp;How are you using mobile to increase traffic?</p>
<p><b>Fukuchi:</b>&nbsp;The AIR MILES rewards program introduced its mobile app in 2010. It was the first loyalty application of its kind for smartphone users in the country. It was introduced as a response to the growing popularity of mobile devices. To date, there has been more than 950,000 downloads of the app and overall, we are seeing 25% of all traffic to our digital properties coming from a mobile device. In order to optimize that experience, we have also launched a mobile site and a tablet app.</p>
<p>We are also very excited about the impact of mobile while in-store. The AIR MILES mobile app enables you to look up sponsor locations and check in for offers. We have had more than 6 million check-ins to date, with the average user checking in every week.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;To date, there has been more than 950,000 downloads of the app and overall, we are seeing 25% of all traffic to our digital properties coming from a mobile device.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p><b>eMarketer:</b>&nbsp;How significant of a role does location-based services play in your mobile efforts?</p>
<p><b>Fukuchi:</b>&nbsp;We want to be where our collectors are, and the AIR MILES app enables us to do so. Collectors can quickly find the closest sponsor locations in Canada. We have more than 10,000 locations. They can use the app to check in and receive relevant offers so they can maximize earnings on the spot. Some sponsors also offer bonus reward miles simply for checking in.</p>
<p>The key to location-based services as part of a mobile program is to present customers with relevant, personal and contextual offers. Geofencing and push notifications, while significant in the US markets, is just starting to be leveraged in Canada, and the technologies are still emerging.</p>
<p><b>eMarketer:</b>&nbsp;How much revenue percentagewise are you seeing from your mobile efforts? How is this different from previous years?</p>
<p><b>Fukuchi:</b>&nbsp;In 2012, AIR MILES saw an immediate and sustained transactional lift of between 5% and 20% following the launch of the updated app with a new &ldquo;check-in&rdquo; feature. Our mobile initiatives have shown that a mobile strategy can help drive significant consumer engagement with a strong return on investment.</p>
<p><b>eMarketer:</b>&nbsp;Can you compare and contrast your mobile app vs. mobile website in terms of performance? Is it important to your business to have one or the other, or both?</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Our mobile initiatives have shown that a mobile strategy can help drive significant consumer engagement with a strong return on investment.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p><b>Fukuchi:</b>&nbsp;Both our mobile app and mobile website are key parts of our long-term vision for mobile. We leverage the app to deliver an exceptional experience for Android devices, as well as for iPhone and iPad users. Meanwhile, the mobile web provides access on the go for customers on other devices and platforms.</p>
<p>We believe it&rsquo;s important to ensure a great customer experience across all interaction points&mdash;mobile app and web provide unique opportunities to deliver the most robust and efficient experience depending on the user needs.</p>
<p><b>eMarketer:</b>&nbsp;Responsive design is top of mind for marketers in the US. Is it the same in Canada? How does this help mobile gain traction with your collectors?</p>
<p><b>Fukuchi:</b>&nbsp;Responsive design is also top of mind for marketers in Canada, as we have seen smartphone penetration continue to increase, and the use of multiple devices to interact with brands via laptop, smartphone and tablet is on the rise. The complexity of managing across multiple platforms can be resource and budget intensive, and responsive design is a solution that can help simplify this complexity.</p>
<p><b>eMarketer:</b>&nbsp;Do you experiment with mobile payments? If so, what?</p>
<p><b>Fukuchi:</b>&nbsp;AIR MILES recognizes that mobile payments will become an increasingly important part of the shopping experience over the next few years. When we ask AIR MILES collectors what kind of mobile capabilities they want in the future, we are hearing that they want access to relevant and personalized offers, as well as ways to ensure they earn AIR MILES everywhere they shop.</p>
<p>There is interest in mobile payments, but also a lot of confusion about exactly what mobile wallets are all about. We are currently working closely with our sponsors to enhance the mobile shopping experience to increase customer engagement and streamline the in-store checkout experience.</p>",,,,,,SYSTEM_HOST,,0

<p>In the case of bourbon, the popular distillery Maker's Mark realized the depth of its customers&rsquo; dedication--and anger--when it announced it would reduce its alcohol level to meet demand. Its customers howled and Maker&rsquo;s Mark quickly changed its decision, deepening engagement in the process.</p>
<p>The beer boon took place after a Red Cross employee mistakenly sent a tweet referencing a four-pack of Dogfish Head beer with the message, &ldquo;when we drink we do it right #gettngslizzerd.""&nbsp;<a href=""http://money.cnn.com/2011/02/17/smallbusiness/dogfish_redcross/"" target=""_blank"">Dogfish Head quickly jumped on the hashtag and asked its fans to donate to the Red Cross</a>. The Red Cross, meanwhile, responded with humor: ""the Red Cross is sober and we've confiscated the keys.""</p>
<p>Both of these events lead to a theory--that negative word of mouth may actually indicate brand passion and lead to increased sales and engagement--if acted upon appropriately and quickly. (Of course, there are notorious examples of&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.fastcompany.com/1723944/kenneth-coles-tone-deaf-tweet-vodafones-coerced-texts-salad-dressing-drug-charges-business-m"" target=""_self"">lost causes</a>.)</p>
<p>So when the Air Miles Reward Program, operated by LoyaltyOne, recently made a couple of program changes, it decided to closely follow the social media response. The results are in a report coauthored by researchers at Northwestern University, called &ldquo;<a href=""https://loyalty.com/knowledge/articles/positive-power-negative-word-mouth"" target=""_blank"">The Positive Power of Negative Word-of-Mouth</a>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The research revealed some unexpected numbers, particularly regarding perception and, in the case of loyalty programs, increased redemptions. As the report puts it, &ldquo;The very instance of negative engagement is both a warning and, when best practices are employed, an opportunity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Among the findings: Those customers who posted comments to social media were 70% more actively engaged with the brand than non-posters.</p>
<p><strong>Surprising Activity</strong></p>
<p>The study analyses the outcome of when the Air Miles Reward Program made a couple of key program changes. One of these changes affected guidelines for reward miles redemption, a sensitive area for loyalty customers.</p>
<p>Realizing this, and knowing that engaged members tend to express their opinions when program rules change, LoyaltyOne flagged the shared member commentary on its community website. Researchers and linguistic analysts from Northwestern University's Medill IMC Spiegel Research Initiative examined all posts related to the program&rsquo;s changes. Linking each post and related viewing activity to LoyaltyOne&rsquo;s transaction and redemption data, the analysts compared behaviors for a 15-week period against a control group of 10,000 offline loyalty program members.</p>
<p>They expected some verbal pushback, but they were surprised by actual member activity afterward.</p>
<p>First, the researchers determined that those members who posted comments were generally more valuable customers--70% more actively engaged--and that their negative comments stemmed from their emotional connection with the brand. They were, as the report describes it, &ldquo;more passionate in expressing their opinions.&rdquo; A similar phenomenon took place in the story involving Maker&rsquo;s Mark.</p>
<p>Passion can lead to activity, and it did for air miles. About one-third of those who posted comments redeemed reward points soon afterward. They also increased their collection activity by 36%. That compares with a 21% lift among redeemers in the control group.</p>
<p>How did the researchers account for such positive results? During the commentary period, LoyaltyOne responded to specific questions and clarified any inaccuracies when they were posted. This is a critical point of the research: LoyaltyOne&rsquo;s strategy at the time was to offset the negative perceptions and comments with simultaneous positive experiences, basically exposing its most dedicated members to the core values that initially attracted them to the brand.</p>
<p>This brand-love approach is similar to how the Red Cross restored its reputation by relying on its crisis-management expertise (with humor) and how Maker&rsquo;s Mark depended on its quality (with alcohol).</p>
<p><strong>Turning Frowns Upside Down</strong></p>
<p>Through the research, LoyaltyOne found that brands could challenge the loyalty of even emotionally engaged consumers. It is up to the organization to monitor the relationship regularly and reinforce the elements that make it positive. This goes double when implementing change.</p>
<p>If we have the data and the resources to launch a timely response plan that is genuinely worded, we can turn negative word of mouth into good publicity and improved business.</p>
<p>Here are some tips for leveraging that brand passion and keeping the relationship strong:</p>
<p><strong>Use the data:</strong>&nbsp;Analyze transactions, redemptions, and social media traffic data from both social media posters and viewers during and after any period that may provoke negative word of mouth.</p>
<p><strong>Be fleet of foot:</strong>&nbsp;Prepare to act quickly if negative commentary begins to contribute to unwanted media buzz and declining sales. A targeted response plan should express genuine appreciation for the comments and promote positive product or brand qualities.</p>
<p><strong>Watch your own word of mouth:</strong>&nbsp;Let customers know their opinions are welcome. Recognize their commentary and react in a nonconfrontational manner to reassure posters and viewers alike that the brand cares about what they have to say.</p>
<p><strong>Go public:</strong>&nbsp;Angry comments can diminish brand integrity and cause other readers to second guess their own purchases. Publicly responding through the same social media channels can ensure that the positive changes are seen.</p>
<p>As always, it&rsquo;s best to prepare for a response plan by first identifying what makes customers loyal to the brand in the first place. Because, whether it&rsquo;s bourbon or beer, loyalty programs or the Red Cross, any brand can make a mistake. But it takes passion on both sides to turn it into an opportunity.</p>",,,,,,SYSTEM_HOST,,1

No wonder firms are focusing their strategy, energy, and budget on processes that enhance knowledge of and engagement with customers.”","<p>What&rsquo;s a successful business without loyal customers? In a recent study, Forrester Research said, &ldquo;We have entered the age of the customer &mdash; an age in which customer obsession matters more than any other strategic imperative.&rdquo; True. No wonder firms are focusing their strategy, energy, and budget on processes that enhance knowledge of and engagement with customers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Our loyal customers affirm our goodwill and successes. But as our businesses get more and more customer centric, the big question is - how do we build on that loyalty to drive sustainable value and competitive advantage?</p>
<p><strong>To do the working, we&rsquo;ll first have to do the talking</strong></p>
<p>The roles of CFOs and CMOs are fast changing.We know they can no longer operate as singular entities, exclusive of each other, because they have a lot more in common now.Both are relentlessly building value, while minimizing costs and risks.And for this they need to justify and multiply the return on investments on assets, tangible as well as intangible.</p>
<p>Intangible assets such as customer, brand, loyalty, intellectual capital et al now contribute almost 80 per cent of return on investment, as against the earlier 20 per cent.Customers, loyalty and customer intelligence, therefore, form the bedrock of growth and strategies for CFOs and CMOs.</p>
<p>Both the C-level executives are under tremendous pressure to deliver sustainable financial results in the near term and in the longer term. And they are also under pressure from a tenure perspective, with an average of 24 and 36 months. So if the CFO and CMO can share more than a working relationship they will be able to invest in a way that will spell benefit for both.</p>
<p><strong>Is loyalty a part of your strategy yet?</strong></p>
<p>Maybe it is not. And you might want to look at it for the better.Forrester Research says that fewer than only 15 per cent of firms operate at a strategic level of customer intelligence. These are firms that have managed to turn customer knowledge into a corporate asset and they apply it to drive corporate strategy and business operations.</p>
<p>Firms that use customer intelligence at a strategy level drive improvements in customer acquisition, retention,satisfaction, revenue, profitability, and customer value in the short term as well as in the long term.But the thing to remember is that strategically intelligent firms will most likely have a senior-level sponsor or champion: a C-level customer intelligence evangelist. This is the person who successfully leads, makes innovations and reinventsthe strategy from time to time for long-term business impact.</p>
<p><strong>It is time to look beyond the hurdles</strong></p>
<p>We all know how it works. The CFO and CMO approach the business from two different perspectives: the CMO is targeting the business from a customer experience perspective and the CFO is trying to drive it from a financial perspective. And many times they tend to be at odds, and then there is tension in the air.</p>
<p>Measurement is always a hurdle. CFOs and marketing departments do not have robust methods to measure customer experience, loyalty and other similar things. And they often struggle in presenting their case to the CFO to make investments in brands, in customer loyalty and employee training to drive better customer experience. As such investments in these areas become the first things to be ticked off the list by the CFO when there is pressure on numbers.</p>
<p>So many of the high-performing companies have nowadays adopted a more methodical and data-based approach and have used the idea of business value as a competitive advantage.&nbsp;These companies acquire numbers and analyse data to get insights about what drives their strategy, as against looking at multiple things from a non-financial perspective. This approach helps CFOs and CMOs understand requirements and constraints and find solutions, strategies and implementation methods (together) for long-term growth and success.</p>
<p><strong>Striking a thriving balance</strong></p>
<p>Is it too hard to strike a balance when the objective is the same? CFOs and CMOs have a common objective: to build value and increase profitability. To be able to complement each other&rsquo;s functional objective to achieve their larger strategic goals, CFOs and CMOs are increasingly building a working relationship. They are findingtime in their busy schedules to meet, share interests and build rapport.</p>
<p>Understanding both sides of risk is critical for the CFOs and CMOs.But what is the best way to do it? To begin with, they should be able to think creatively and collaboratively, not only about the risks of the proposed marketing action, but also the risk of not acting. Generally speaking, CFOs are familiar with a variety of risk assessment. With the help of the CFO, CMOs should perform risk assessments of marketing strategies and become comfortable with the appropriate assessment tools. While CMOs are often not as adept at assessing risk, CFOs are often not as comfortable at assessing the risk of not acting. By collaborating, it is more likely that the business will arrive at a decision that best fits the situation and the organization.</p>
<p><strong>What works&hellip;</strong></p>
<p>In the end, we know that the mantra is always to rely on trust if things get rocky. No one can foresee everything:competitors may change plans, markets may get choppy and complicated and results are many times inconclusive. It is best not to second guess but trust each other to do the best thing possible for the business. And this can only happen if the CFO and CMO have understanding of each other&rsquo;s objectives and priorities, and a relationship in place.</p>
<p>As Jerry Rebel, the CFO of Jack in the Box suggested, &ldquo;The CFO-CMO relationship is one of the most important in today&rsquo;s risk-sensitive, growth-focused environments.&rdquo; In the end, the real emphasis &mdash; and real business value &mdash; hinges on prioritizing the relationship, learning to speak the other&rsquo;s language, and respecting the unique point of view that each brings.&rdquo;</p>",,,,,,SYSTEM_HOST,,1

The trick is determining what&rsquo;s a fair price.</p>
<p>Advancing technologies are enabling marketers to price products and services based on intricate detail, such as product shelf life, individual consumer behavior, demand and proximity, according to a&nbsp;<a href=""http://thecurvereport.com/category/trends/the-price-is-right-now/"" target=""_blank"">recent story</a>&nbsp;in&nbsp;<i>The Curve Report</i>.</p>
<p>With new flex pricing models, the story states, &ldquo;Prices shift based on a wide range of variables, from external factors like expiration date and stock market fluctuations to personal data such as proximity and social clout. And while shopping history&minus;based loyalty programs have helped consumers score deals for decades, expect these programs to gain new dimensions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The topic is not necessarily new. In fact, a&nbsp;<a href=""http://pearson4loyalty.com/2012/07/we-all-have-a-price-as-long-as-it-is-a-fair-one/"" target=""_blank"">blog item I wrote</a>&nbsp;more than a year ago addressed practices by some companies that priced offers based on the consumer&rsquo;s profile. The risk, I noted then, was of being misinterpreted as unfair.</p>
<p>That still applies. Historically, most organizations looked at price as a default promotional tool &ndash;when all else fails, you can sell products by cutting the price. But now data enables us to use price as a strategic lever to get the right customer to make purchases. It can literally be used at the customer level as a way to promote selective trial of products or to recognize specific behaviors.</p>
<p>But there is a risk, and that is of under-defining the data. Some consumers may behave as if they are not price sensitive, but in certain categories they may be hyper price sensitive. If they are overlooked for certain promotions, they may feel the brand is not offering a fair opportunity across the board.</p>
<p>However, if we use the data as a way to define the full spectrum of consumer preferences and activity, across categories and channels, price can be used to ensure customers are introduced to the right products and services in the right way. A shopper may pay top price for mangoes, for instance, but balk at expensive goat cheese. She may be willing to spend more on a Friday than on a Monday, or less in an urban store than a suburban store. Add mobile and online channels, and the variables multiply.</p>
<p>We certainly should be prepared, because some consumers might soon demand to know&nbsp;<i>their&nbsp;</i>price. According to the Curve Report story, it tested several new flex pricing models and as many as 76 per cent of 18- to 49-year-olds were interested in at least one of them. Two-thirds (66 per cent) said they&rsquo;d prefer pricing that is flexible rather than fixed.</p>
<p>So instead of seeing price as the last line of defense in a fluid marketing environment, think of it as one more strategic arrow in your quiver. Just be sure it hits the target, fair and square.</p>",,,,,,SYSTEM_HOST,,1

<p>Most Canadians sign up for more loyalty rewards programs than they can manage. In fact, according to the 2013 COLLOQUY Loyalty Census, the average Canadian household is involved in an average of 8.2 loyalty programs &mdash;which some believe is inefficient and disadvantageous to both the retailer and the consumer. &ldquo;With nine pieces of plastic in the average Canadian&rsquo;s wallet just&nbsp;for loyalty programs, not counting credit cards and other things, you can imagine that we&rsquo;re constantly running around with this wad of plastic on us,&rdquo; says Ken Wong, a marketing professor at the Queen&rsquo;s School.</p>
<p>According to Wong, it&rsquo;s likely that many Canadians sign up for loyalty rewards programs without considering the rewards structure, how frequently they need to earn points, and how long it will take to redeem rewards. As a result, many reward cards go unused and many Canadians forfeit the benefits they deserve.</p>

Forming and executing loyalty programmes well is not just a marketer's job; it is equally an operations, technology and finance head's job, Anirban Dutta tells Devina Joshi","<p><em>Interview with, Managing director, LoyaltyOne India</em></p>
<p>Forming and executing loyalty programmes well is not just a marketer's job; it is equally an operations, technology and finance head's job, Anirban Dutta tells Devina Joshi</p>
<p><strong>Do you believe the loyalty programmes that exist in the country today are successful or do most retailers have them for namesake, without a correct understanding of customer relationship management?</strong></p>
<p>Every loyalty programme ought to start with an objective which is financial-metric driven. When you start a consumer engagement programme, you must establish a baseline that this programme will generate 'X' number of sales in a certain time limit. If you don't meet your objective, you don't have a baseline for such a programme. And this is the awareness we are trying to bring about with our clients as well. The objective has to be financial-a loyalty programme is as much a CFO conversation as it is a CMO conversation.</p>
<p><strong>Shoppers Stop, for instance, has its own loyalty card and may house brands like Levi's or Bata, which also have their own loyalty cards. This confuses the consumer on which card to use. Do you believe consolidation by retailers on the loyalty front is the way out?</strong></p>
<p>Consolidation is a good way forward. In the classical cycle, there are early movers, following which there will be proliferation and then consolidation. India is at the end of the proliferation cycle. Over the last five to seven years, retailers have launched loyalty programmes and only a few of them have been successful. In India, we are struggling with what 'good' looks like, at the last mile. For instance, at a food outlet, a cashier who is also contending with a queue that is fast building up to make a payment, is the one who lands up managing your loyalty programme.</p>
<p>Enabling great execution is one of the key design metrics that we are discussing with our clients. If you don't make it simple enough or empower consumers - technologically or decision-wise - it will fail at the front end no matter how exotically it is designed at the back-end.</p>
<p><strong>Clearly there is a lack of streamlining with the redemption process as well. A customer gets nonsensical 'points' which she has to redeem at different desks and the reward may not be all that rewarding. What's the solution?</strong></p>
<p>After addressing the basic tenet of why a loyalty programme is being created, the next stage is to trigger a chain management process for it. That is where organisations are struggling. The execution of it is not just the marketing team's job; it is as much an operations job as it is a technology team's job to be enablers in this. It is also the finance team's job to be able to take a return on investment view of it. It is an organisation-wide effort to engage the consumer.</p>
<p>Imagine a reward in a high-frequency retail scenario where you're running across four desks trying to get your reward. You'll do it once or twice, but you'll probably not do it again. A loyalty programme is often confused with 'points earn and burn' but it is not that. It is a structure, a tacit transaction between a consumer and the brand where the consumer gets a reward and recognition from the brand. On its part, the brand gains not just a consumer, but also information about consumer behaviour through transaction history. One person's information gets extrapolated to thousands of others and one can just imagine the richness of that data. If you make this exchange difficult, you won't get that information.</p>
<p><strong>When one talks of Big Data, retailers seem to be sitting on a bank of information that they are not utilising well. What are the ways to monetise it?</strong></p>
<p>The first and most obvious monetisation is using that pile of information to make changes in the way you talk to your customers, the way you load up brochures and even the way you design the stores, or even the way you price the products. All of us receive information from retailers. If retailers could store this kind of information, they would know that a customer shouldn't be targeted by emails if she responds by her texts instead. So it isn't just shopper behaviour; it is about knowing a customer's media consumption habits too.</p>
<p><strong>Do you think a concept like loyalty coalition, such as Imint that you worked on, is the next big wave in the loyalty industry?</strong></p>
<p>In Canada, we invented coalition as a concept with Air Miles (a retail-based coalition with seven partners formed in 1993). There are loyalty programmes, then they evolve it into great loyalty programmes, then partnerships start getting formed to augment the offering. This eventually evolves into a coalition. Will it be in the same form like it happened in Canada? I don't think so. There will be an Indian avatar that will come up. With such a heterogeneous country, one size will not fit all and it will be hazardous to copy-paste an existing model.</p>
<p>Coalition is a set up that works in a data rich environment. It not only helps a retailer to know what a consumer is buying from him but also what she is buying from others. However, Indian retailers need to take a stab at their own data before getting into concepts like coalition. A retailer must track his own pricing, his own merchandising and his own promotions before taking on a multi-partnering concept like coalition. Having said that, we are not very behind the West in terms of loyalty. Those markets took 25 years in achieving sophisticated loyalty marketing. Because of legacy, it is difficult to make leaps. Since we don't have a legacy of loyalty marketing in India, we have the opportunity to make that leap.</p>
<p><strong>Service industries like aviation and hospitality seem to understand loyalty better than others and take it more seriously. Why aren't product-based retailers catching up?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, some have adopted it faster than others. Loyalty is most relevant when the frequency of purchase is high. You probably wonder if you should be signing up for loyalty programmes for transactions you do once a year. Grocery, fuel, banking or telecom are high frequency transactions, as opposed to, say, jewellery. Some industries like retail are struggling to get organised in the first place. So once retailers get the fundamentals of their business right, we will see a growth in organised loyalty concepts. Services do not have a tangible product, so recognition and a relationship is very important here. Banks have a huge opportunity to use data for example, like risk data. It is an integral part of their business to analyse credit-worthiness data anyway, so they may as well look at the response part of it as well. Co-branded cards are a result of such analysis. Or a bank may use data to figure out to whom can it give a great home loan rate, for instance. Retail will catch up.</p>
<p><strong>Is it a wise strategy to send mass emails out to a database? Often these are irrelevant, and look like 'spam'&hellip;</strong></p>
<p>Loyalty programmes give retailers information about the transaction and the consumer. Mass proliferation in loyalty programmes doesn't work. We need to undo the damage done by retailers already in this regard. It's important to focus on the three 'R's of loyalty programmes: rewards, relevance and recognition. Retailers must stitch their offering around these. For example, during our work with leading grocers in Canada, consumers were offered coupons that contained the photograph of the store manager - that's the level of personalisation I see coming into India too, with the aid of technology and design.</p>

<p>""Retailers need to get much better at understanding the specific needs of this very valuable segment of consumers and they have to work out the different ways they can help satisfy these needs,"" said Graeme McVie, vice-president of business development at U.S.-based marketing strategy and research firm LoyaltyOne.</p>
<p>""Tailoring the shopping and the products that are in the store to cater to this group is actually a really good idea because there's a huge number of them and they're actually willing to make trade-offs when it comes to value to get health benefits.""<br /><br />Many baby boomers who have become empty nesters or retired have the disposable income to spend and they're willing to spend it on themselves, especially when it comes to buying healthier food and high-quality beauty products, McVie said.</p>
<p>That may mean spending more for the heart-friendly omega-3 eggs instead of the plainest and cheapest kind, or getting a high-quality soap that will be kind to their skin.</p>
<p>McVie says this comes in part from a growing awareness about healthy living, as well as a realization that if they are going to live longer, boomers should take better care of themselves.</p>
<p>""They think about it as making an investment in their own health rather than an expense to minimize at all costs,"" he said.<br />Susan Eng, vice president for advocacy at CARP Canada, says that while she agrees there are high-spenders in the boomer demographic, many seniors are also struggling and shouldn't be forgotten.</p>
<p>A sluggish economy, boomerang kids who won't move out, aging parents, a lack of savings and medical challenges are all weighing on boomers, who are ending up with high debt levels, more working years, and even the threat of bankruptcy.</p>
<p>""The one thing about the boomers is that they're such a big demographic, that anything that the group does, in all its variety and diversity, will suddenly seem to be a trend,"" said Eng.</p>
<p>""It is true that there's a whole pile of them that are well off, and yes, they will spend on their health. But you also have people facing the same health-care challenges and they don't have the money. They're looking around and saying: 'Where do I turn?""'</p>
<p>To boomer Chuck Nyren, who has spent years working in advertising and has written a book about selling to his demographic, one of the keys to drawing in the 50-plus crowd is to stop treating them like they're old.</p>
<p>The problem with ad campaigns for products targeted at boomers, he says, is that advertising firms don't know how to treat that group.<br />""If they do it at all, it's only for products that are medical, maybe vacations,"" he said in an a telephone interview from his home in Snohomish, Wash., near Seattle.</p>
<p>""If you're over 50 and you watch television, it just keeps reinforcing the fact that you're sick. That automatically kind of turns you off to everything. They think of baby boomers as either old, smiling vapid people on a beach, or as old hippies.""</p>
<p>Boomers buy a variety of products, just like younger people do, and pigeonholing them into certain categories isn't going to help retailers make the most out of their shopping dollars, he added.</p>
<p>And to Nyren, 62, in-store marketing isn't doing much better.</p>
<p>""If you walk into a mall, it just gets annoying because there's so much noise that is directed toward younger people, even for products that are for older people, and it doesn't really grab you anymore,"" he said.</p>
<p>Clearer labels and product information that is more easily available are two simple ways McVie says can help draw in consumers.</p>
<p>Smaller shopping carts at grocery stores with magnifying glasses attached, an emphasis on single or double-serve portions instead of family packs, promotions that target price over quantity and mobile apps that help people locate and learn about products are also ways to cater to the boomer group, he said.</p>
<p>Some changes can be as simple as moving where an item sits on the shelf.</p>
<p>""You've got people that are in their 60s and 70s who want those products but actually find it hard to reach them, and when they do reach them, sometimes they knock things over and they fall on top of them,"" McVie said.</p>
<p>""The smarter retailers need to realize that they need to tailor the in-store experience for those individuals.""</p>",,,,,,SYSTEM_HOST,,0

<p>Alliance&rsquo;s LoyaltyOne division, which is headed by Bryan Pearson and based in Toronto, runs the Air Miles operation that has 120 merchant partners and more than 10 million accounts across Canada.</p>
<p><strong>You are pushing $1-billion in revenue now and have a big market share. Is there still room to grow?</strong></p>
<p>When you&rsquo;ve got seven out of 10 Canadian households with [an Air Miles] card in their wallet, going to eight or nine out of 10 households is less realistic than getting those people to use the card more frequently and in new retail categories.</p>
<p>The best way to get a new category opened is to add new partners.</p>
<p><strong>What kind of new partners do you want to add?</strong></p>
<p>Up until three or four years ago, we had great grocery partners, Shell as a gas partner, and financial services partners in American Express and Bank of Montreal, but if you walked into a mall or a power centre, there wasn&rsquo;t a great penetration. So specialty retail has been a big focus of ours. In the last three years, we&rsquo;ve added Michaels, Staples, Toys &ldquo;R&rdquo; Us, the Children&rsquo;s Place, and Old Navy.</p>
<p><strong>What does a loyalty program do for a retailer or other business?</strong></p>
<p>The actual reward mechanism does induce behavioural change out of consumers. But more important, the information [gathered about purchases] creates real value for companies.</p>
<p><strong>So card holders are essentially trading information about their purchases for points?</strong></p>
<p>A loyalty program creates a value exchange between the consumer and the company. The reward currency is a thank you for spending your money on products and services. The flip side is that [companies gather] information that is mission critical in building their brand. They can better serve customers by understanding them at a completely different level.</p>
<p>When we first started the business 20-plus years ago, I felt like somebody who had walked into a [dark] room that was full of customers of my clients, and we turned the light on for the first time, so [our clients] could see who they really were.</p>
<p>Today, we take it as standard that you should understand who your customers are and what segments there are and how those spend differently. But I am surprised at companies that have this wealth of information but have created a kind of data ghetto, where it sits in the marketing or sales or customer service department and doesn&rsquo;t find its way into the broader organization as a foundation for strategic decision-making.</p>
<p><strong>Are some consumers becoming leery of sharing so much data about themselves with merchants?</strong></p>
<p>I have run two years of privacy research across North America. Consumers recognize that information is being gathered about them, and are disappointed with the level of customization or personalization that companies are delivering as a result.</p>
<p><strong>So their concern is that the information is not being used?</strong></p>
<p>[We asked if people would] share more information with a trusted organization if they knew the company would act on it to create a more relevant or personalized experience. Two-thirds of consumers said they would share more information.</p>
<p>There is a vocal group of people who are raising concerns about how information is being used. A lot of that comes back to the level of transparency that companies have around what they are gathering, and whether they have a structured agreement from the consumer.</p>
<p>And there certainly is a creepy line, where you do cross boundaries.</p>
<p><strong>So people like offers to be tailored to their interests?</strong></p>
<p>We have a program with a grocer where we use customer information to create customized offerings. It is completely individualized based on what you buy in the grocery store. How many complaints, out of millions of pieces that we send out, do we get about privacy? None.</p>
<p><strong>There are a lot of individual loyalty cards out there, and Aeroplan is developing a &ldquo;partner&rdquo; network. Is the competitive environment tougher than it was?</strong></p>
<p>We have seen a rise in standalone programs, but there are few coalition or partner programs. Certainly Aeroplan is out there, and they have done a great job in leveraging a frequent-flier program by adding partners. They have a niche that serves higher-spending Canadians in the credit card market [but] we have the highest penetration in every socio-demographic segment.</p>
<p><strong>When does it make sense for a retailer to join a partner plan rather than running their own loyalty program?</strong></p>
<p>Each business has its own dynamics. If, at the end of a year of spending, all [a company] can afford is to give somebody back enough to buy a couple of pencils, they should join a coalition program. In one, you are paying all the freight, and in the other, you are sharing the administrative costs.</p>
<p><strong>How does Canada compare internationally when it comes to loyalty programs?</strong></p>
<p>We rank right up there as one of the most competitive marketplaces. Many U.S. programs have defaulted to just straight discounting programs. If you show a card, you get a discounted price. We have stayed with a points rewards structure.</p>
<p><strong>What about the rest of the world?</strong></p>
<p>Coalition programs are a global phenomenon. The only market where you don&rsquo;t have a meaningful coalition like an Air Miles program is the U.S. That&rsquo;s because it is more fragmented. The retail community is much more regionalized. You don&rsquo;t have many large national players. In Canada, we have a lot of national chains and we have a little bit more of an ethos of co-operation around that.</p>
<p><strong>You have a Brazilian subsidiary. How did you end up there?</strong></p>
<p>We looked at some of the big emerging markets and thought a coalition program was a great opportunity in a place where the vast majority of the population doesn&rsquo;t have the means to spend dramatic amounts of money in any particular retail area. Brazil has a robust banking environment, and the population uses debit and credit. And we had a partner who had been operating an online coalition in the marketplace and wanted to [broaden it] but needed someone who could bring experience to help.</p>
<p><strong>How has this business changed in ways you might not have predicted when you started 20 years ago?</strong></p>
<p>What has changed dramatically is the environment that we operate in. Twenty years ago, there was no Internet, no mobile telephony, and no GPS location-based services. And the immediacy is completely different. Look at the contrast between putting something in somebody&rsquo;s mailbox compared to pinging them on their mobile phone.</p>
<p><strong>Has the shift to smartphones created a great opportunity?</strong></p>
<p>The smartphone is the first marketing device that the consumer carries with them at all times. It has got incredible utility, but the consumer has proved time and again that if you are either inappropriate or inconsiderate in how you choose to access them, they will turn you off. [The key is] to create a meaningful value exchange with the customer.</p>
<p><strong>Why are loyalty programs &ndash; which go back decades to green stamps and Canadian Tire money &ndash; still so popular?</strong></p>
<p>I think they tap into some psychological behavioural aspect that consumers have [where they want to] earn and work towards something. It taps into an element of their psychology, some basic instinct.</p>",,,,,,SYSTEM_HOST,,0

As the Baby Boomer generation ages, the population aged 65 or older is expected to more than double between 2012 and 2060 to reach an astounding 92 million. The U.S. Census Bureau projects that by 2060, one in every five U.S. residents will fall into the 65 plus age category, up from one in seven today.</p>
<p>This silver tsunami can certainly pose some real challenges for retailers. With that said, the rise of the aging consumer also creates many opportunities for retailers on which to capitalize. The good news is most retailers already possess the key tool needed for success: Data.</p>
<p>Customer data has the potential to transform the customer experience by delivering more relevant, targeted offerings that can be tailored specifically to this consumer base. Retailers that can identify key demographic trends through their customer data, and then adjust the customer shopping experience accordingly, will be best positioned to gain a competitive advantage.</p>
<p>In order to capitalize on the impending shift in the U.S. consumer population, retailers should consider the following:</p>
<p>Tailor the shopping experience. The physical layout of stores will play a significant role in attracting and retaining a mature consumer base. Retailers that cater their infrastructure to their rising consumer base by lowering shelf heights to allow for accessible products, providing wide aisles and ensuring easy-to-read labels and signs or providing on-cart magnifying glasses, will encourage a loyal following.</p>
<p>Rethink promotions. In-store promotions that encourage consumers to purchase larger quantities will become increasingly less relevant as the senior cohort increases in size. Consider monetary discounts instead of buy-one-get-one-free promotions.</p>
<p>Adapt the assortment. In a similar vein to the previous point, retailers will need to re-think pack sizes. Seniors living in households with one or two mouths to feed will not need large pack sizes, especially in categories that are perishable. Fresh, healthy, ready-made meal options in single or double portions would be an ideal offering for seniors.</p>
<p>Healthcare consumerism is rising. With rapid growth in the drugstore channel to accompany aging shoppers, consider bolstering pharmacy offers to meet the increasing demand for discretionary and essential health care products and services. Pricing for health-related products will be key&mdash;setting prices at the appropriate level for discretionary health-related products may allow lower prices to be offered on essential healthcare products. With many seniors facing lower benefits from social security programs, making essential healthcare products affordable will go a long way to earn the loyalty of seniors. Pharmacy convenience is also key. Over-the-phone and online prescription re-fills would be appreciated by customers who are not very mobile or do not have easily accessible transit options.</p>
<p>Tap into Technology. Unlike the previous generation of seniors, the aging baby boomer is familiar with technology. An increasing number of seniors are integrating the Internet into their daily lives and digital communications are fast becoming an efficient way to engage and inform. Recent research by the Pew Internet and American Life Project indicated that 87% of senior citizens use e-mail and search engines and one of the largest user groups on Facebook is seniors. And the number of senior Internet users is only growing. eMarketer forecasts that there will be over 26 million senior users by 2015. This is a ready avenue for retailers to deliver targeted, relevant offers using data through a loyalty program to increase engagement.</p>
<p>The success of retail has always rested on an industry&rsquo;s ability to adapt and respond to market changes and challenges. The aging baby boom generation is no exception. If retailers wisely use analytics to properly segment and tailor their offerings, their relationship with this high-spend customer group will continue to strengthen, and in turn create strong customer loyalty.</p>",,,,,,SYSTEM_HOST,,1

<p>It's tough to put a price on a well-stocked grocery store. Merchandisers have long used the insights derived from customer data to ensure adequate inventory levels that meet customer demand&ndash;from the desired brands to an appropriate selection to size and quantity. But the data can be pushed even further.</p>
<p>By using information collected through loyalty programs, grocers can deliver the kinds of products consumers want at the right price as well, in a strategy known as personalized pricing.</p>
<p>Personalized pricing, or the practice of tailoring prices in conjunction with demand, consumer behavior and competition, is already winding its way through the grocery store aisles. By investing in targeted, individualized prices, savvy grocers are ensuring wise investment decisions while simultaneously providing highly relevant offers to customers that satisfy their specific needs. And they&rsquo;re reaping the benefits.</p>
<p>The world&rsquo;s largest online retailer, Amazon, is a leader in the personalization space because of the data it collects on an individual customer&rsquo;s buying and browsing behaviour and the web-based nature of its business.</p>
<p>According to the American Customer Satisfaction Index, Amazon ranks highest in customer satisfaction among Internet, department, discount and specialty retailers. Simply put, its customers are happy.</p>
<p>In the grocery sector, Tesco, Kroger and Safeway are leaders in the use of loyalty program data to identify products in which customers are most interested in receiving discounts.</p>
<p>As a starting point, these personalized offers are determined at the customer segment level, meaning all customers in the segment receive offers for the same products. Then, as a best practice, each offer is optimized to the individual customer. Every customer receives a customized list of the items that matter most to them at the right price.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s going to come a point where our shelf pricing is pretty irrelevant because we can be so personalized in what we offer people,&rdquo; said former Safeway CEO Steven Burd earlier this year, according to the AP.</p>
<p>For instance, as outlined in The Loyalty Leap &ndash; Turning Customer Information into Customer Intimacy, LoyaltyOne used loyalty program data to help Sobeys, Canada&rsquo;s second-largest supermarket chain, appeal to its customers at a personalized level.</p>
<p>With these loyalty insights, Sobeys was able to create one-to-one direct-mail pieces for its loyalty card members, each of which was based on a member&rsquo;s specific purchasing behavior. Of the one million pieces created and mailed, each of them were unique, with a dozen customized product offers and coupons in each.</p>
<p>Then, to be sure they reached consumers wherever they were, the offers were distributed through all channels&ndash;direct mail, e-mail and the web.</p>
<p>The results? Sobeys saw double-digit consumer response rates, a 66% increase in promotional recalls, a 37% unique open rate for emails, and a 26% click-through rate.</p>
<p>Such campaign results are not only desirable by today&rsquo;s grocers, they are attainable. More grocery retailers can ensure they are appropriately rewarding their customers by delivering highly relevant promotions, and personalized prices, on items that are of greatest importance to customers through:</p>
<p><strong>Leveraging digital delivery mechanisms:</strong></p>
<p>Using their loyalty program data as a guide, retailers can provide tailored prices to individual customers in the form of electronic coupons delivered via email or by asking customers to sign in to their account on the retailer&rsquo;s website. These coupons can be loaded onto the customer&rsquo;s loyalty card for redemption at the register.</p>
<p><strong>Incorporating mobile or smartphone technology:</strong></p>
<p>Further leveraging their loyalty program, retailers can send electronic coupons via text message or apps to a customer&rsquo;s mobile phone, incorporating time of day or location into their delivery. These offers can then be redeemed by scanning barcodes or QR codes at the register.</p>
<p><strong>Rewarding loyal customer segments with specific promotional prices:</strong></p>
<p>Individual in-store promotions can be designed to target specific customer segments with prices that are tailored to reward those consumers for their brand loyalty. Consumers who tend to shop during off-peak hours, for example, can receive invitations to a limited shopping event that would be taking place in a specific, two-hour period.</p>
<p><strong>Partnering with leading manufacturers:</strong></p>
<p>Since manufacturers already fund many digital coupons, they represent a partnership opportunity for retailers. By overlaying their insights, retailers and manufacturers can increase the relevance of these coupons to specific customers based on individual buying behavior.</p>
<p>Personalized or tailored pricing is a powerful tool for achieving grocery success. The best part: Customers, as well as retailers, benefit from more targeted and relevant offers.</p>
<p>While it may be tough to put a price on a well-stocked grocery store, customer data can allow grocers to put a well-thought price to the right products.</p>",,,,,,SYSTEM_HOST,,1

These gatherings were immensely inspirational and everyone in the room strongly agreed that cross sector co-creation and shared value is the way of the future.</p>
<p>But many also agreed that the challenge now is figuring out how to take that thinking back to the real world (now that we've all gone back to our companies, cities, nations). How ready are consumers for private sector/public sector partnerships? How ready are consumers for companies to make profit while doing good?</p>
<p>Surprisingly, many leaders at these meetings said that business often resists talking about profit with shared value initiatives because of public skepticism and mistrust. This is crazy -- when business creates shared value for social good and profit, companies can't be uncomfortable talking about it. If government is investing public dollars to impact positive social change, they shouldn't be cautious in celebrating it. Many organizations are making positive societal contributions now and are not allowing themselves to get the credit that they deserve because of an exaggerated fear of public backlash.</p>
<p>How did it come to this? After a series of business and government corruption scandals and the global financial crisis, the public is reportedly at the highest levels of mistrust ever. In June 2012, Forbes Magazine ran an article headlined ""Trust in Business Falls off a Cliff."" In February of this year PBS reported that public distrust of the U.S. government is at the boiling point -- the highest in decades. Edelman's annual Trust Barometer showed that only 62 per cent of Canadians and 58 per cent of Americans trust our business and government to make the right decisions. This same report summarized the key defining issue of public concern of 2013 as being ""Crisis in Leadership"", and in 2010 it was the need for ""Business to Partner with Government to Regain Trust.""</p>
<p>These reports and others are all saying that the public is on high alert. But the right response is not to step back and wait for a more welcoming time to innovate. Instead, business and government need to charge right back at this doubt. By doing so in an authentic, transparent manner, we will drive results and improve trust. Companies need to strongly define and activate their corporate character more than ever to earn trust, says the Arthur W. Page Society, a global association of leading chief communications officers and senior PR experts. They have designed a business model called ""Building Belief"" to specifically help companies do this.</p>
<p>And the good news is that several companies and government organizations are already doing this exceptionally well. Google's website states ""Make a Profit and Don't Do Evil"" as one of their key values. They state boldly right up front that they are a business and make no apologies for it. They also commit to operating their business following key guiding principles to maintain integrity and consumer trust.</p>
<p>Another company who excels in shared value and corporate character is Patagonia, which is so committed to the protection of nature that they donate one per cent of sales to environmental groups globally. As well, the AIR MILES Reward Program has created AIR MILES for Social Change to use the incredible power and reach of the AIR MILES Reward Program to inspire and reward Canadians for taking care of their health and the planet. The Public Health Agency of Canada has partnered with AIR MILES for Social Change in an innovative way to fight the obesity epidemic in Canada. The unique partnership encourages fitness habits in Canadian families of all ages by rewarding them for exercising more frequently at the YMCA.</p>
<p>It is time for business and government to boldly lead. By combining profit and purpose with cross-sector co-creation that drives positive social change, we will create new solutions and rebuild public trust. And most importantly, it needs to be done with the utmost transparency and authenticity. This has to happen right away if we are going to achieve the societal solutions and benefits that our country needs today.</p>

In a recent conversation with Direct Marketing News Bryan Pearson, author of The Loyalty Leap for B2B: Turning Customer Information Into Customer Intimacy and president and CEO of LoyaltyOne, addressed these difficulties, and passionately explained his strategies for successfully building trust and intimacy with B2B customers.</p>
<p><strong>What are the characteristics of a successful B2B organization and how are they getting there?</strong></p>
<p>[One] characteristic of a successful B2B is that it's focusing on understanding customers at a more granular level and working to create relevant programs and communications for them. It's also about allowing it as foundation to foster better relationships with customers over time. That's part of the DNA of the organization&mdash;developing deeper insight on customers and formulating integrated strategies.</p>
<p><strong>You stress the requirement for businesses to develop trust. What are the best ways to accomplish this?</strong></p>
<p>It starts with identifying and understanding key companies and customers and differentiating them from prospects. Tracking interactions over time and understanding the kind of activity they have over time in your business. Once you have that view of the customer, [then it's] about how you actually act against that knowledge to build trust and relevance.</p>
<p>Trust is earned by using information you have to build the customer experience and streams of relevant interactions with those customers.</p>
<p>To understand various customer touchpoints you have to create relevance within those touchpoints. Make sure you're getting feedback from those touchpoints so that you can figure out whether you're achieving the mutual goals you have set with yourself and your customers. And make sure you continuously measure and adjust plans [based on] whether you're achieving success and hitting your goals or not.</p>
<p>It sounds mundane but at the end of the day success with building trust within a B2B environment is really about understanding the underlying dynamics of your business. [It's also about] being conscientious about how you architect the experience and touchpoints you have with your customers&mdash;to [achieve] the desired outcome from the customer segments you're pursuing.</p>
<p><strong>What are the difficulties of creating recognition for customer loyalty in B2B that differs from B2C?</strong></p>
<p>I think in a B2C environment what you see is tiering&hellip;. That works well where there's attribution back to an individual&mdash;and it would work equally well in small business environment. The problem is that when you deal with [midsize] business or enterprises, tiering itself doesn't translate well into those environments. You need to look at other means to create recognition.</p>
<p>B2B companies have moved to giving out awards for customer recognition&hellip;. Recognition is still a powerful tool in the loyalty tool kit in B2B organizations&mdash;it just needs to be applied and thought of in a different manner.</p>
<p><strong>How does a B2B best achieve enterprise loyalty?</strong></p>
<p>Enterprise loyalty is about capturing information about your customers&mdash;organizing [that information] into the way you create insight and understanding, and using that as a platform across your organization to change the conversation and strategic context in which decisions are made. Most organizations are product-based&mdash;&ldquo;what service do I sell?&rdquo; They may understand the market they're selling to, but they may not understand the full view across the whole organization about how their customers are actually embracing products and services, and how the organization can enhance what they're doing to build a richer value proposition.</p>
<p><strong>What are some key lessons you've learned throughout your career about creating customers for life?</strong></p>
<p>1. Understand the purpose of your organization and ensure that you focus 100% on delivering against the experience customers would expect from buying that product or service.</p>
<p>2. Once you think you got it right, never stop focusing on what you can do better. The spirit of continuous improvement is what keeps you relevant, growing, and ultimately creates health and sustainability for your business over time.</p>",,,,,,SYSTEM_HOST,,0

So why are supermarket loyalty membership numbers falling? And why has one major grocery company pulled the plug on its loyalty program?</p>
<p>In the grand scheme of things, customer loyalty programs seem to be rapidly on the rise. According to a study by the research firm Colloquy, the number of U.S. loyalty program memberships grew by 26.7% from 2010 to 2012. Last year, Americans had a collective total of 2.65 billion loyalty program memberships.</p>
<p>But the study reveals that these programs may not be quite as ascendant as they initially appear. &ldquo;Even though the average number of loyalty programs per U.S. household has grown to 21.9 (up from 18.4 in 2010), only 9.5 of those memberships &ndash; less than half &ndash;are currently active,&rdquo; the report states.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s more, certain loyalty program categories actually saw a decrease in memberships. In 2012, Americans had 172.4 million supermarket loyalty program memberships, down from 173.7 million in 2010. That&rsquo;s a decrease of only 1%. But considering that until recently loyalty program totals have generally only gone upward, and that most program categories saw robust growth, any decline in memberships is significant. Combine that with the fact that the percentage of memberships that are active has been falling across the board, and what becomes apparent is that many consumers have grown sick of having to fumble through a pocketbook to find a loyalty card at the grocery store.</p>
